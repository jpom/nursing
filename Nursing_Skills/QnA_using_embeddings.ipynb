    "Many use cases require GPT-3 to respond to user questions with insightful answers. For example, a customer support chatbot may need to provide answers to common questions. The GPT models have picked up a lot of general knowledge in training, but we often need to ingest and use a large library of more specific information.\n",

       "      <th>Anatomic Sites Anatomic sites must be selected carefully for intramuscular injections andinclude the ventrogluteal, vastus lateralis, and the deltoid. The vastus\\nlateralis site is preferred for infants because that muscle is most\\ndeveloped. The ventrogluteal site is generally recommended for IM\\nmedication administration in adults, but IM vaccines may be administered\\nin the deltoid site. Additional information regarding injections in each of\\nthese sites is provided in the following subsections.\\nVentrogluteal\\nThis site involves the gluteus medius and minimus muscle and is the\\nsafest injection site for adults and children because it provides the\\ngreatest thickness of gluteal muscles, is free from penetrating nerves and\\nblood vessels, and has a thin layer of fat. To locate the ventrogluteal site,\\nplace the patient in a supine or lateral position. Use your right hand for the\\nleft hip or your left hand for the right hip. Place the heel or palm of your\\nhand on the greater trochanter, with the thumb pointed toward the belly\\nbutton. Extend your index finger to the anterior superior iliac spine and\\nspread your middle finger pointing towards the iliac crest. Insert the\\nneedle into the âVâ formed between your index and middle fingers. This is\\nthe preferred site for all oily and irritating solutions for patients of any age.\\nfor an image demonstrating how to accurately locate theSee Figure 18.31\\nventrogluteal site using your hand.\\nThe needle gauge used at the ventrogluteal site is determined by the\\nsolution of the medication ordered. An aqueous solution can be given\\nwith a 20- to 25-gauge needle, whereas viscous or oil-based solutions are\\ngiven with 18- to 21-gauge needles. The needle length is based on patient\\nweight and body mass index. A thin adult may require a 5/8-inch to 1-inch\\n(16 mm to 25 mm) needle, while an average adult may require a 1-inch (25\\nmm) needle, and a larger adult (over 70 kg) may require a 1-inch to 1Â½-\\nneedles. Refer to  agency policies regarding needle length for infants,\\nchildren, and adolescents. Up to 3 mL of medication may be administered\\nin the ventrogluteal muscle of an average adult and up to 1 mL in children.\\nfor an image of locating the ventrogluteal site on aSee Figure 18.32\\npatient.\\nVastus Lateralis\\nThe vastus lateralis site is commonly used for immunizations in infants\\nand toddlers because the muscle is thick and well-developed. This muscle\\nis located on the anterior lateral aspect of the thigh and extends from one\\nhandâs breadth above the knee to one handâs breadth below the greater\\ntrochanter. The outer middle third of the muscle is used for injections. To\\nhelp relax the patient, ask the patient to lie flat with knees slightly bent or\\nhave the patient in a sitting position. See Figure 18.33\\nfor an image of the\\nvastus lateralis injection site.\\nThe length of the needle used at the vastus lateralis site is based on the\\npatientâs age, weight, and body mass index. In general, the recommended\\nneedle length for an adult is 1 inch to 1 Â½ inches (25 mm to 38 mm), but\\nthe needle length is shorter for children. Refer to agency policy for\\npediatric needle lengths. The gauge of the needle is determined by the\\ntype of medication administered. Aqueous solutions can be given with a\\n20- to 25-gauge needle; oily or viscous medications should be\\nadministered with 18- to 21-gauge needles. A smaller gauge needle (22 to\\n25 gauge) should be used with children. The maximum amount of\\nmedication for a single injection in an adult is 3 mL. See Figure 18.34\\nfor\\nan image of an intramuscular injection being administered at the vastus\\nlateralis site.\\nDeltoid\\nThe deltoid muscle has a triangular shape and is easy to locate and access.\\nTo locate the injection site, begin by having the patient relax their arm.\\nThe patient can be standing, sitting, or lying down. To locate the landmark\\nfor the deltoid muscle, expose the upper arm and find the acromion\\nprocess by palpating the bony prominence. The injection site is in the\\nmiddle of the deltoid muscle, about 1 inch to 2 inches (2.5 cm  to 5 cm)\\nbelow the acromion process. To locate this area, lay three fingers across\\nthe deltoid muscle and below the acromion process. The injection site is\\ngenerally three finger widths below in the middle of the muscle. See\\nFigure 18.35\\nfor an illustration for locating the deltoid injection site.\\nSelect the needle length based on the patientâs age, weight, and body\\nmass. In general, for an adult male weighing 60 kg to 118 kg (130 to 260\\nlbs), a 1-inch (25 mm) needle is sufficient. For women under 60 kg (130 lbs),\\na  â-inch (16 mm) needle is sufficient, while for women between 60 kg\\nand 90 kg (130 to 200 lbs) a 1-inch (25 mm) needle is required. A 1 Â½-inch\\n(38 mm) length needle may be required for women over 90 kg (200 lbs)\\nfor a deltoid IM injection. For immunizations, a 22- to 25-gauge needle\\nshould be used. Refer to agency policy regarding specifications for infants,\\nchildren, adolescents, and immunizations. The maximum amount of\\nmedication for a single injection is generally 1 mL. See Figure 18.36\\nfor an\\nimage of locating the deltoid injection site on a patient.</th>\n",

Headaches\\nrange greatly in severity of pain and frequency of occurrence. For example,\\nsome patients experience mild headaches once or twice a year, whereas\\nothers experience disabling migraine headaches more than 15 days a\\nmonth.  Severe headaches such as migraines may be accompanied by\\nsymptoms of nausea or increased sensitivity to noise or light. Primary\\nheadaches occur independently and are not caused by another medical\\ncondition. Migraine, cluster, and tension-type headaches are types of\\nprimary headaches. Secondary headaches are symptoms of another\\nhealth disorder that causes pain-sensitive nerve endings to be pressed on\\nor pulled out of place. They may result from underlying conditions\\nincluding fever, infection, medication overuse, stress or emotional conflict,\\nhigh blood pressure, psychiatric disorders, head injury or trauma, stroke,\\ntumors, and nerve disorders such as trigeminal neuralgia, a chronic pain\\ncondition that typically affects the trigeminal nerve on one side of the\\ncheek.\\nNot all headaches require medical attention, but some types of headaches\\nof headaches that require immediate medical attention include a sudden,\\nsevere headache unlike any the patient has ever had; a sudden headache\\nassociated with a stiff neck; a headache associated with convulsions,\\nconfusion, or loss of consciousness; a headache following a blow to the\\nhead; or a persistent headache in a person who was previously headache\\nfree.</th>\n",
