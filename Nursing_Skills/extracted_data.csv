CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.3 Vital Signs,Pulse,"A patient’s oxygenation status is routinely assessed using pulse oximetry,"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.3 Vital Signs,Pulse,referred to as SpO2. SpO2 is an estimated oxygenation level based on the
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.3 Vital Signs,Pulse,saturation of hemoglobin measured by a pulse oximeter. Because the
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.3 Vital Signs,Pulse,majority of oxygen carried in the blood is attached to hemoglobin within
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.3 Vital Signs,Pulse,"the red blood cells, SpO2 estimates how much hemoglobin is “saturated”"

CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,"patient’s general appearance, behavior, mobility, and communication."
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,Items to consider when assessing general appearance include the
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,following:
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,"•  Signs of pain or distress: Patients may exhibit signs of pain or distressthat should be reported to the provider such as grimacing, moaning,"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,or increased anxiety. Set the priorities for your focused assessments
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,based on any signs of distress demonstrated by your patient.
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,•  Age: Observe if the patient appears their stated age. Chronic disease
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,can cause a patient to appear older than their age. Factors can occur
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,with older adults that may influence how well the patient can
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,"participate in the assessment, such as hearing, vision, or mobility"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,impairments.
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,•  Body type: No patient is exactly the same; some patients are in good
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,physical shape and others are not. Body type can reflect nutritional
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,status and lifestyle choices.
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,"•  Hygiene, grooming, and dress: Observe the overall cleanliness of the"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,poor hygiene or various disease states. Validate odors by performing
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,additional focused assessments as needed. Note the appearance of
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,"the patient’s clothing; is it clean and appropriate for the season? If not,"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,"findings can reflect on a patient’s cognitive abilities, emotional state,"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,General Appearance,and ability to complete daily activities.
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"While observing the patient, note their behaviors during your interaction."
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,Consider the following items:
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,•  Affect and mood: People express their mood through facial
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"expressions, eye contact, what they do, and what they say. Eye contact"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,is commonly used to judge a person’s mood because people who are
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"feeling down or depressed commonly avoid eye contact. However, be"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,aware that cultural beliefs may also affect the use of eye contact.
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,Affect refers to the outward display of one’s emotional state. For
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"example, a patient with a  “flat affect” refers to very few facial"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"expressions being displayed to indicate emotion, which is often"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,associated with depression. If the patient’s mood or behavior seems
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"inappropriate for their current situation, make a note of that as well."
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"For example, a patient in an usually elated mood in a situation when"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,most people would be seriously concerned can be a symptom of
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,mental illness.
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,•  Family dynamics: If other family members are accompanying the
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"patient, note the characteristics of their interactions. Family dynamics"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,are the patterns of interactions between family members that
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"influence family structure, hierarchy, roles, values, and behaviors."
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,Family dynamics have a strong impact on the way children see
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"themselves, others, and their world. They can also impact the lifestyles"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,daily living and health care.
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,•  Signs of patient abuse: Abuse occurs in many different forms such as
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"physical, emotional, mental, verbal, sexual, economic, or financial."
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,Most states mandate nurses and other health care professionals to
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,report suspected child and elder abuse to the proper authorities.
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"Observe if your patient seems fearful, excessively quiet, or has physical"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"signs of abuse, such as bruising or burn marks. If you suspect abuse,"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,attempt to interview the patient alone. Promptly report your concerns
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,according to agency policy and state mandates.
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,•  Substance use disorder: Approach your patient in a caring and
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"nonjudgmental way, but be aware that unusual signs or behaviors can"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"be indicators of substance use disorder. For example, if a patient’s"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,"pupils are unusually dilated or constricted, this can be a sign of"
CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY,1.4 Basic Concepts,Behavior,substance use disorder. Contact the provider with concerns about

CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,start with a simple problem of converting ounces to milliliters to
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,demonstrate the technique of dimensional analysis.
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,Practice Problem #1: Ounces to Millileters
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,A patient drank an 8 ounce can of juice. The nurse must document the
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,intake in milliliters. How many milliliters of juice did the patient drink?
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,Here is an example of how to solve this conversion problem using
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,dimensional analysis.
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,"1. Identify the unit being solved for as the goal. In this example, we want to"
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,"convert the patient’s oral intake from ounces to milliliters, so we are"
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,solving for milliliters (mL):
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,2. Set up the numerator in the first fraction to match the desired unit to
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,"be solved. In this case, we want to know how many milliliters should be"
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,"documented, so mL is placed in the numerator. To complete the fraction,"
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,"we add information already known. In this example, we know that 30 mL"
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,"is equivalent to 1 ounce, so 30 mL is added to the numerator and 1 ounce is"
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,added to the denominator:
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,3. Add the  second fraction to the equation. When using dimensional
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,"analysis, fractions are set up so the same units are diagonal from each"
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,"other so they cancel each other out, leaving the desired unit. For this"
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,"problem, the second fraction is set up to include ounces in the numerator"
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,so that it will cancel out ounces in the denominator of the first fraction. “8”
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,is then added to the numerator because we know from the problem that
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,the patient consumed 8 ounces. “1” is then added to the denominator
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,because the purpose of the second fraction is to cancel out units:
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,4. Cancel out similar units that are diagonal to each other. After canceling
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,"out ounces, we are left with our desired units of mL:"
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,5. Multiply across the numerators and then multiply across the
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,denominators:
CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS,5.7 Conversions,Ounces to Milliliters,6. Divide the numerator by the denominator to get the final answer with

CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,"bridge of the nose consists of bone, but the protruding portion of the nose"
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,is composed of cartilage. The nares are the nostril openings that open into
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,the nasal cavity and are separated into left and right sections by the nasal
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,septum. The floor of the nasal cavity is composed of the palate. The hard
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,palate is located at the anterior region of the nasal cavity and is composed
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,of bone. The soft palate is located at the posterior portion of the nasal

CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,humidify the incoming air as it moves into the pharynx. The pharynx is a
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,tube-lined mucous membrane that begins at the nasal cavity and is
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,"divided into three major regions: the nasopharynx, the oropharynx, and"
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,the laryngopharynx.
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,The nasopharynx serves only as an airway. At the top of the nasopharynx
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,"is the pharyngeal tonsil, commonly referred to as the adenoids. Adenoids"
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,are lymphoid tissue that trap and destroy invading pathogens that enter
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,during inhalation. They are large in children but tend to regress with age
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,and may even disappear.
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,The oropharynx is a passageway for both air and food. The oropharynx is

CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,The laryngopharynx is inferior to the oropharynx and posterior to the
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,larynx. It continues the route for ingested material and air until its inferior
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,"end where the digestive and respiratory systems diverge. Anteriorly, the"
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,"laryngopharynx opens into the larynx and posteriorly, it enters the"
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,esophagus that leads to the stomach. The larynx connects the pharynx to
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,the trachea and helps regulate the volume of air that enters and leaves
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,the lungs. It also contains the vocal cords that vibrate as air passes over
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,them to produce the sound of a person’s voice. The trachea extends from
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,the larynx to the lungs. The epiglottis is a flexible piece of cartilage that
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,covers the opening of the trachea during swallowing to prevent ingested

CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,SWALLOWINGSwallowing is a complex process that uses 50 pairs of muscles and many
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,"nerves to receive food in the mouth, prepare it, and move it from the"
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,mouth to the stomach. Swallowing occurs in three stages. During the first
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,"stage, called the oral phase, the tongue collects the food or liquid and"
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,makes it ready for swallowing. The tongue and jaw move solid food around
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,in the mouth so it can be chewed and made the right size and texture to
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,swallow by mixing food with saliva. The second stage begins when the
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,tongue pushes the food or liquid to the back of the mouth. This triggers a
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,swallowing response that passes the food through the pharynx. During
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,"this phase, called the pharyngeal phase, the epiglottis closes off the larynx"
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT,7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,Anatomy,and breathing stops to prevent food or liquid from entering the airway

CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"chest configuration, and symmetry of expansion."
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,•  Assess the level of consciousness. The patient should be alert and
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,cooperative.  Hypoxemia (low blood levels of oxygen) or hypercapnia
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,(high blood levels of carbon dioxide) can cause a decreased level of
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"consciousness, irritability, anxiousness, restlessness, or confusion."
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,•  Obtain the respiratory rate over a full minute. The normal range for the
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,respiratory rate of an adult is 12-20 breaths per minute.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"•  Observe the breathing pattern, including the rhythm, effort, and use"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,of accessory muscles. Breathing effort should be nonlabored and in a

CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,the inspiration-expiration ratio increases to 1:1.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,•  Observe pattern of expiration and patient position. Patients who
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"experience difficulty expelling air, such as those with emphysema,"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,may have prolonged expiration cycles. Some patients may experience
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,difficulty with breathing specifically when lying down. This symptom
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"is known as orthopnea. Additionally, patients who are experiencing"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,significant breathing difficulty may experience most relief while in a
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,“tripod” position. This can be achieved by having the patient sit at the
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,side of the bed with legs dangling toward the floor. The patient can
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,then rest their arms on an overbed table to allow for maximum lung
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,expansion. This position mimics the same position you might take at
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,the end of running a race when you lean over and place your hands on
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,your knees to “catch your breath.”

CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,number of red blood cells.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,•  Inspect the chest for symmetry and configuration. The trachea should
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"be midline, and the clavicles should be symmetrical. See Figure 10.2"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"for visual landmarks when inspecting the thorax anteriorly, posteriorly,"

CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"scapula, as well as the underlying lobes of the lungs."
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,◦  Chest movement should be symmetrical on inspiration and
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,expiration.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,◦  Observe the anterior-posterior diameter of the patient’s chest and
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,compare to the transverse diameter. The expected
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,anteroposterior-transverse ratio should be 1:2. A patient with a 1:1
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,ratio is described as barrel-chested. This ratio is often seen in
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,hyperinflation of the lungs. See Figure 10.3
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,for an image of a

CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,for areas of air leak or crepitus. Crepitus feels like a popping or
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,crackling sensation when the skin is palpated and is a sign of air
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"trapped under the subcutaneous tissues. If palpating the chest, use"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,light pressure with the fingertips to examine the anterior and
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,posterior chest wall. Chest palpation may be performed to assess
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"specifically for growths, masses, crepitus, pain, or tenderness."
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,•  Confirm symmetric chest expansion by placing your hands on the
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"anterior or posterior chest at the same level, with thumbs over the"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"sternum anteriorly or the spine posteriorly. As the patient inhales, your"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,thumbs should move apart symmetrically. Unequal expansion can
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"occur with pneumonia, thoracic trauma, such as fractured ribs, or"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,pneumothorax.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,Auscultation
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"Using the diaphragm of the stethoscope, listen to the movement of air"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,through the airways during inspiration and expiration. Instruct the patient
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,to take deep breaths through their mouth. Listen through the entire
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,respiratory cycle because different sounds may be heard on inspiration
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"and expiration. As you move across the different lung fields, the sounds"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,because the size of the airways change.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,Correct placement of the stethoscope during auscultation of lung sounds
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,is important to obtain a quality assessment. The stethoscope should not
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,be performed over clothes or hair because these may create inaccurate
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,sounds from friction. The best position to listen to lung sounds is with the
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"patient sitting upright; however, if the patient is acutely ill or unable to sit"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"upright, turn them side to side in a lying position. Avoid listening over"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"bones, such as the scapulae or clavicles or over the female breasts to"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,ensure you are hearing adequate sound transmission. Listen to sounds
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,from side to side rather than down one side and then down the other side.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,This side-to-side pattern allows you to compare sounds in symmetrical
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,lung fields. See Figures 10.5

CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,EXPECTED BREATH SOUNDSIt is important upon auscultation to have awareness of expected breath
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,sounds in various anatomical locations.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,•  Bronchial breath sounds are heard over the trachea and larynx and
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,are high-pitched and loud.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,•  Bronchovesicular sounds are medium-pitched and heard over the
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,major bronchi.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"•  Vesicular breath sounds are heard over the lung surfaces, are lower-"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"pitched, and often described as soft, rustling sounds."
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,ADVENTITIOUS LUNG SOUNDSAdventitious lung sounds are sounds heard in addition to normal breath
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"sounds. They most often indicate an airway problem or disease, such as"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"accumulation of mucus or fluids in the airways, obstruction, inflammation,"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"or infection. These sounds include rales/crackles, rhonchi/wheezes, stridor,"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,and pleural rub:
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"•  Fine crackles, also called rales, are popping or crackling sounds heard"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,on inspiration that occur in association with conditions that cause
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"fluid to accumulate within the alveolar and interstitial spaces, such as"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,heart failure or pneumonia. The sound is similar to that produced by
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,rubbing strands of hair together close to your ear.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,•  Wheezes are whistling-type noises produced during expiration (and
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,sometimes inspiration) when air is forced through airways narrowed
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"by bronchoconstriction or associated mucosal edema. For example,"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,patients with asthma commonly have wheezing.

CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,Life Span Considerations
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,CHILDRENThere are various respiratory assessment considerations that should be
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,noted with assessment of children.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,•  The respiratory rate in children less than 12 months of age can range
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"from 30-60 breaths per minute, depending on whether the infant is"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,asleep or active.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,•  Infants have irregular or periodic newborn breathing in the first few

CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"full minute. During this time, you may notice periods of apnea lasting"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,up to 10 seconds. This is not abnormal unless the infant is showing
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,other signs of distress. Signs of respiratory distress in infants and
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,children include nasal flaring and sternal or intercostal retractions.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"•  Up to three months of age, infants are considered “obligate” nose-"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"breathers, meaning their breathing is primarily through the nose."
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,•  The anteroposterior-transverse ratio is typically 1:1 until the thoracic
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,muscles are fully developed around six years of age.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"OLDER ADULTSAs the adult person ages, the cartilage and muscle support of the thoraxbecomes weakened and less flexible, resulting in a decrease in chest"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"expansion. Older adults may also have weakened respiratory muscles, and"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,breathing may become more shallow. The anteroposterior-transverse ratio
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,may be 1:1 if there is significant curvature of the spine (kyphosis).
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,Percussion
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,Percussion is an advanced respiratory assessment technique that is used
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,by advanced practice nurses and other health care providers to gather
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,additional data in the underlying lung tissue. By striking the fingers of one
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"hand over the fingers of the other hand, a sound is produced over the"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,lung fields that helps determine if fluid is present. Dull sounds are heard
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"with high-density areas, such as pneumonia or atelectasis, whereas clear,"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"low-pitched, hollow sounds are heard in normal lung tissue."
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,•  Because infants breathe primarily through
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,"the nose, nasal congestion can limit the"
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,amount of air getting into the lungs.
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,•  Attempt to assess an infant’s respiratory
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,rate while the infant is at rest and content
CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT,10.3 Respiratory Assessment,Objective Assessment,rather than when the infant is crying.

CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,minute or for those receiving oxygen therapy for longer periods of time.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,Nasal cannulas are the most common type of oxygen equipment. They are
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,"used for short- and long-term therapy (i.e., COPD patients) and are best"
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,used with stable patients who require low amounts of oxygen.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,Flow rate: Nasal cannulas can have a flow rate ranging from 1 to 5 liters
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,"per minute (L/min), with a 4% increase in FiO2 for every liter of oxygen,"
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,resulting in range of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) levels of 24-44%.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,"Advantages: Nasal cannulas are easy to use, inexpensive, and disposable."
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,They are convenient because the patient can talk and eat while receiving
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,oxygen.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,"Limitations: The nasal prongs of nasal cannula are easily dislodged,"
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,especially when the patient is sleeping. The tubing placed on the face can
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,"cause skin breakdown in the nose and above the ears, so the nurse must"
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,"vigilantly monitor these areas. Based on agency policy, the nurse should"
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,add padding to the oxygen tubing as needed to avoid skin breakdown and
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,"may apply a water-based lubricant to prevent drying. However,"
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,petroleum-based lubricant should not be used due to the risk of
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Nasal Cannula,flammability. Nasal cannulas are not as effective if the patient is a mouth

CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,A simple mask fits over the mouth and nose of the patient and contains
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,"exhalation ports (i.e., holes on the side of the mask) through which the"
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,patient exhales carbon dioxide. These holes should always remain open.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,The mask is held in place by an elastic band placed around the back of the
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,head. It also has a metal piece near the top that can be pinched and
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,shaped over the patient’s nose to create a better fit. Humidified air may be
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,attached if the oxygen concentrations are drying for the patient. See
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,Figure 11.13
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,for an image of a simple face mask.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,"Flow Rate: Simple masks should be set to a flow rate of 6 to 10 L/min,"
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,resulting in oxygen concentration (FiO2) levels of 35%-50%. The flow rate
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,should never be set below 6 L/min because this can result in the patient
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,rebreathing their exhaled carbon dioxide.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,Advantages: Face masks are used to provide moderate oxygen
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,concentrations. Their efficiency in oxygen delivery depends on how well
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,the mask fits and the patient’s respiratory demands.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Simple Mask,"Disadvantages: Face masks must be removed when eating, and they may"

CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,and the bag and also on the covers on the exhalation ports. The reservoir
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,"bag should never totally deflate; if the bag deflates, there is a problem and"
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,immediate intervention is required. The one-way valves function so that
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,"on inspiration, the patient only breathes in from the reservoir bag; on"
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,"exhalation, carbon dioxide is directed out through the exhalation ports."
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,Non-rebreather masks are used for patients who can breathe on their own
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,but require higher concentrations of oxygen to maintain satisfactory blood
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,oxygenation levels.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,Flow rate: The flow rate for a non-rebreather mask should be set to deliver
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,a minimum of 10 to 15 L/minute. The reservoir bag should be inflated prior
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,"to placing the mask on the patient. With a good fit, the non-rebreather"
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,mask can deliver between 60% and 80% FiO2.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,Advantages: Non-rebreather masks deliver high levels of oxygen
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,noninvasively to patients who can otherwise breathe unassisted.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,"Disadvantages: Due to the one-way valves in non-rebreather masks, there"
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,is a high risk of suffocation if the gas flow is interrupted. The mask requires
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,a tight seal and may feel hot and confining to the patient. It will interfere
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Non-Rebreather Mask,"with talking, and the patient cannot eat with the mask on."
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Partial Rebreather Mask,The partial rebreather mask looks very similar to the non-rebreather mask.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Partial Rebreather Mask,The difference between the masks is a partial rebreather mask does not

CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Partial Rebreather Mask,"inhaled air.  A partial rebreather mask requires 10-15 L/min of oxygen, but"
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Partial Rebreather Mask,only delivers 35-50% FiO2.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Venturi Mask,Venturi masks are indicated for patients who require a specific amount of
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Venturi Mask,"supplemental oxygen to avoid complications, such as those with chronic"
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Venturi Mask,obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Different types of adaptors are
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Venturi Mask,attached to a face mask that set the flow rate to achieve a specific FiO2
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Venturi Mask,ranging from 24% to 60%. Venturi adapters are typically set up by a

CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Venturi Mask,according to agency policy.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Venturi Mask,Flow rate:  The flow rate depends on the adaptor and does not correspond
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Venturi Mask,to the flow meter. Consult with a respiratory therapist before changing the
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Venturi Mask,flow rate.
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY,11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,Venturi Mask,Advantages: A specific amount of FiO2 is delivered to patients whose

CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,MUSCLE ATROPHYMuscle atrophy is the thinning or loss of muscle tissue. See Figure 13.3
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,for
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,an image of muscle atrophy. There are three types of muscle atrophy:
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,"physiologic, pathologic, and neurogenic."
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,Physiologic atrophy is caused by not using the muscles and can often be
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,reversed with exercise and improved nutrition. People who are most
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,affected by physiologic atrophy are those who:
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,"•  Have seated jobs, health problems that limit movement, or decreased"
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,activity levels
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,•  Are bedridden
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,•  Cannot move their limbs because of stroke or other brain disease
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,"•  Are in a place that lacks gravity, such as during space flights"
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,"Pathologic atrophy is seen with aging, starvation, and adverse effects of"
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,long-term use of corticosteroids. Neurogenic atrophy is the most severe
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,type of muscle atrophy. It can be from an injured or diseased nerve that
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,connects to the muscle. Examples of neurogenic atrophy are spinal cord
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,injuries and polio.
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,Although physiologic atrophy due to disuse can often be reversed with
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,related atrophy are especially pronounced in people who are sedentary
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,because the loss of muscle results in functional impairments such as
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,"trouble with walking, balance, and posture. These functional impairments"
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Muscles,can cause decreased quality of life and injuries due to falls.
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,Joints are the location where bones come together. Many joints allow for
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,movement between the bones. Synovial joints are the most common
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,type of joint in the body. Synovial joints have a fluid-filled joint cavity
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,where the articulating surfaces of the bones contact and move smoothly
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,against each other. See Figure 13.4
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,for an illustration of a synovial joint.
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,where they come together and allows the bones to glide over each other
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,with very little friction. Articular cartilage can be damaged by injury or
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,normal wear and tear. Lining the inner surface of the articular capsule is a
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,thin synovial membrane. The cells of this membrane secrete synovial
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,"fluid, a thick, slimy fluid that provides lubrication to further reduce friction"
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,between the bones of the joint.
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,Types of Synovial Joints
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,There are six types of synovial joints. See Figure 13.5
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,for an illustration of

CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,the following subsections.
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,SHOULDER JOINTThe shoulder joint is a ball-and-socket joint formed by the articulation
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,between the head of the humerus and the glenoid cavity of the scapula.
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,This joint has the largest range of motion of any joint in the body. See

CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,"the upper limb such as during throwing, swimming, or racquet sports."
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,HIP JOINTThe hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint between the head of the femur and
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,the acetabulum of the hip bone. The hip carries the weight of the body
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,and thus requires strength and stability during standing and walking.
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,See Figure 13.7
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,"A common hip injury in older adults, often referred to as a “broken hip,” is"
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,actually a fracture of the head of the femur. Hip fractures are commonly

CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,collateral ligament is on the lateral side of the knee and spans from the
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,lateral side of the femur to the head of the fibula. The medial collateral
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,ligament runs from the medial side of the femur to the medial tibia. The
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,tibial collateral ligament crosses the knee and is attached to the articular

CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,Inside the knee joint are the anterior cruciate ligament and posterior
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,cruciate ligament. These ligaments are anchored inferiorly to the tibia and
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,run diagonally upward to attach to the inner aspect of a femoral condyle.
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,The posterior cruciate ligament supports the knee when it is flexed and
CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT,13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,Joints,weight-bearing such as when walking downhill. The anterior cruciate

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,and creating symptoms of dizziness and perspiration. Sometimes the
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,patient can faint or even have a seizure. Patients with a history of cardiac
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,arrhythmias should not be administered rectal suppositories due to the
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,potential for a vasovagal response. Always follow agency policy and
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,procedure when administering rectal medications.
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,Another type of rectal medication is an enema. An enema is the
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,administration of a substance in liquid form into the rectum.  Many
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,enemas are formulated in disposable plastic containers. Warming the
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,solution to body temperature prior to administration may be beneficial
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,because cold solution can cause cramping. It is also helpful to encourage
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,the patient to empty their bladder prior to administration to reduce
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,feelings of discomfort. Place an incontinence pad under the patient and
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,position them on their left side in the Sims position. Lubricate the nozzleof the container and expel air. Insert the lubricated nozzle into the rectum
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,slowly and gently expel the contents into the rectum. Ask the patient to
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS,15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,Rectal Medication Administration,retain the enema based on manufacturer’s recommendations.

ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,Topical medications are medications that are administered via the skin or
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"mucous membranes for direct local action, as well as for systemic effects."
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,An innunction is a medication that is massaged or rubbed into the skin
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,and includes topical creams such as nystatin antifungal cream. The
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,transdermal route of medication administration includes patches or disks
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,applied to the skin that deliver medication over an extended period of
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,time. Common types of  transdermal medications are analgesics (such as
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"fentanyl), cardiac medications (such as nitroglycerin), hormones (such as"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"estrogen), and nicotine patches (for smoking cessation). See Figure 16.1"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,for
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,an image of typical packaging of a topical patch. Medications delivered
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,transdermally provide a consistent level of the drug in the bloodstream for
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,distribution. The transdermal route is also helpful for patients who are
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,nauseated or having difficulty swallowing.
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,Heat may be applied with the administration of some inunctions. Heat
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,causes vasodilation that enhances blood flow and improves absorption of
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"some medication. However, heat should never be applied over patches,"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"such as the fentanyl or nitroglycerin patches, because it increases the"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,release of the drug and can cause overdose and death. Be sure to
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,heat.
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"When applying transdermal patches, the nurse should always wear gloves"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,and check the rights of medication administration as is done with other
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"types of medication. Before applying a new patch, the old patch should be"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"removed, the skin around the old patch should be assessed, and the site"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,for the patch cleansed and dried thoroughly. The skin around the patch
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,should be monitored for any irritation or reaction to the medication or
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,patch adhesive. Patches should not be applied to broken or irritated skin.
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"When applying a new patch, the nurse should remove the clear plastic"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,backing and take care to not touch the medication surface of the patch
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,while placing it on the patient’s skin. Patches should be placed on an
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"appropriate skin area per manufacturer guidelines, such as the upper"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,arms or on the chest. The patch should be pressed firmly to the skin for
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"ten seconds to ensure adhesion to the skin. For documentation purposes,"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"the nurse should initial, date, and time a piece of tape that is applied close"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,to the patch. The patch should not be written on directly because this may
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,puncture the patch and cause it to become ineffective. Based on the
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"onset of the medication, the patient should be evaluated to ensure they"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,are responding appropriately to the therapeutic effects of the medication
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,and not experiencing any adverse effects.
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,Patch placement should be routinely assessed for dislodgement per
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"agency policy. For example, for some opioid patches like fentanyl, the"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,nurse is required to assess and document that the patch is present during
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,every shift. The nurse should also be aware that patches with aluminum
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"backing can cause issues with defibrillation and MRI scans, so this type of"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,patch should be removed prior to either of these actions.
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"To remove a patch, the nurse should wear gloves and remove the patch"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,carefully so as not to tear the skin. The patch should be disposed of in the
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"proper waste receptacle per agency policy. For example, some agencies"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,"have specific receptacles for nitroglycerin patches. Additionally, agencies"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,have specific policies for disposal of fentanyl patches to prevent drug
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,diversion of used patches. Patch removal should be documented in the
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Topical and Transdermal Medications,patient’s record.
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,Eye Drops
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,Eye drops are administered for a local effect on the eye. Examples of eye
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"medication to reduce intraocular pressure, and saline drops to relieve dry"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,eyes. The amount of drops to administer per eye is indicated on the
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"provider order. When instilling eye drops, the nurse should perform hand"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"hygiene, apply gloves, and check the same rights of medication"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,administration as done with other types of medication. Prior to
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"administration of eye medication, the patient’s eyes should be assessed"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"for new or unusual redness or drainage. If discharge is present, the eyelids"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,should be cleansed with gauze saturated with warm water or normal
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,saline to remove any dirt or debris that could be carried into the eye
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"during instillation. When cleaning the eyelids, the nurse should clean from"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,the inner canthus toward the outer canthus so as not to introduce debris
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,or dirt into the lacrimal ducts that could cause an infection. A new gauze
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,pad is used for each stroke. The nurse should remove gloves after
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"cleansing, perform hand hygiene, and apply new gloves prior to"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,medication administration.
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"When administering the drops, the patient should be instructed to tilt"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,their head backwards or be positioned in a supine position with their head
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"on a pillow looking up. When the cap of the medication is removed, it"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,should be placed on a clean surface with care taken to keep the inside of
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,the cap sterile and to not contaminate the dropper tip. The patient should
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,look up and away while the nurse gently uses pressure to pull the lower lid
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,down and expose the lower conjunctival sac. By holding the dropper close
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"to the sac without touching it, the nurse should squeeze the bottle and"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"allow the drop to fall into the sac, taking care to not touch the dropper to"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"the eye. After the eye drop has been instilled, the patient should close"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"their eye. The nurse should apply gentle pressure to the inner canthus,"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"when appropriate, to prevent the medication from entering the lacrimal"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,duct and causing a possible systemic reaction to the medication. This
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,procedure should be repeated in the other eye as ordered. The patient
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"should be instructed to not to rub their eye(s). During the procedure, the"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,nurse evaluates the patient’s tolerance of the medication and the

ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"eye drops, except that instead of drops, ½ inch of ointment is placed in the"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"lower conjunctival sac. When applying the ointment, the nurse should"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"start at the inner canthus and move outward.  After application, the"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,patient should be instructed to close their eyelid and move the eye to
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,spread the ointment so it is absorbed. They should be advised they may
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,experience blurry vision for a few minutes until the medication is
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,absorbed.
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,Eye Irrigations
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"Eye irrigations are used to flush foreign bodies from the eye, such as"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"debris or chemicals, using large amounts of saline. The amount of solution"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,and length of time used to irrigate the eye depends on the contaminant.
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,"Follow agency policy when performing eye irrigation. For example, some"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,emergency eye flush stations provide a 15-minute flush to the eye. Care
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,should be taken to not contaminate the other eye while removing the
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Eye Instillations and Irrigations,debris unless it is necessary to flush both eyes.
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"Medications and fluids may be instilled into the ear for local effect,including antibiotics, analgesics, wax softeners, and irrigation fluid to"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,remove foreign objects or wax buildup.  Medications and fluids are
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"instilled into the outer ear canal, with the tympanic membrane forming a"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"thin barrier to the middle and inner ear. However, if the tympanic"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"membrane is ruptured, instillation of ear drops is generally"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"contraindicated unless a sterile, no-touch technique is used. However, if a"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"patient has a surgical opening in the tympanic membrane (i.e.,"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"tympanostomy tubes have been placed), ear drops may be prescribed but"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,caution must be taken not to introduce debris into the middle or inner air.
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,Ear Drops
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"When administering ear drops, the nurse should carefully follow the"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,dosage and amount of drops per ear according to the provider order. The
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"nurse should perform hand hygiene, apply gloves, and check the same"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,rights of medication administration as is completed with other types of
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,medication. The external ear should be cleaned of debris prior to drops
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,being instilled. The patient should be positioned so the affected ear is
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"tilted in the uppermost position. If the patient is lying in bed, position the"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,patient so they are lying with the unaffected ear against the pillow and
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"the affected ear upward. When removing the cap of the medication,"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,caution should be used to not touch the dropper or the inside of the cap
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,to avoid contamination. The pinna of the ear should be grasped and
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"pulled backwards and upwards for an adult. For children, the pinna should"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"be pulled straight back, and for infants, it should be pulled down and"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,back. This movement straightens the auditory canal and prepares it for
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,instillation. The nurse should squeeze the bottle so that the drops of
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,medication fall onto the side of the auditory canal and not directly onto
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,the tympanic membrane. The medication should run towards the
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,tympanic membrane after it is instilled. The tragus can be massaged to
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,help move the medication into place. The patient should remain in this
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"lying position for five minutes. After five minutes, this procedure can be"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"repeated on the other ear, if ordered. Evaluation of the patient should be"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,performed post administration to assess if the patient tolerated theprocedure and if anticipated therapeutic effects occurred. When instilling
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Ear Instillations and Irrigations,"medication or fluids into the ear, monitor for side effects such as dizziness"

ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,A DPI is medication provided in a powder form that is inhaled from the
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,mouth into the lungs using a quick breath to activate the medication and
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,move it into the lungs from the inhaler. An example of Advair Diskus DPI is

ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,"and after the administration of inhaled medications, including assessment"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,"When administering an MDI, the nurse should shake the inhaler and add"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,a spacer onto the mouthpiece. The use of spacers with MDIs is considered
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,best practice because they help ensure the medication is inhaled rather
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,than inadvertently placed in the mouth. They also reduce waste by
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,ensuring the patient receives the full amount of medication. The patient
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,should be instructed to exhale while placing the spacer’s mouthpiece into
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,their mouth. The inhaler is depressed to move the aerosolized medication
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,"into the spacer, and the patient should breathe in normally through the"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,"spacer to receive the medication. If a spacer is not available, the patient"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,should exhale and hold the inhaler mouthpiece about 1 to 2 inches away
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,from their mouth to help ensure the medication is inhaled via the larynx
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,"and not sprayed onto the posterior pharynx. As the inhaler is depressed,"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,the patient should inhale the medication deeply through their mouth and
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,into their lungs. The patient should be advised to hold their breath for 5 to
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,10 seconds after inhaling the medication and then exhale through pursed
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,lips. The patient should wait for 1 to 5 minutes between each puff of
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,"medication. When administering inhaled corticosteroids via MDI, the"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,patient should rinse their mouth with water afterwards to prevent fungal
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,infection.
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,"When using a DPI, the nurse should load the medication into the devices"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,as required and then activate the inhaler per the manufacturer’s
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,guidelines. The patient should be instructed to exhale and then place their
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,lips around the mouthpiece and inhale strongly and deeply. After they
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,"have inhaled, they should hold their breath for 10 seconds or as long as"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,comfortable and then exhale through pursed lips. The patient should wait
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,1 to 5 minutes between puffs of medication. If the DPI contains a
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,"corticosteroid medication, the patient should gargle and rinse with tap"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,water to decrease the risk of developing a fungal infection.
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,"When using a small-volume nebulizer, the nurse pours the liquid"

ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,recommendations. The top end of the tubing is connected to either a
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,nebulizer mask or mouthpiece. The patient should be instructed to inhale
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,slowly through the device into their mouth and hold each breath for a
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,slight pause before exhaling. Remain with the patient during the
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,"nebulizer treatment, which usually takes about 15 minutes. After"
ROUTES,16.2 Basic Concepts,Inhaled Medications,"treatment, the patient should be encouraged to cough and perform oral"

CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE,20.2 Basic Concepts Related to Wounds,Common Types of Wounds,are described below:
CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE,20.2 Basic Concepts Related to Wounds,Common Types of Wounds,•  Stage 1 pressure injuries are intact skin with a localized area of
CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE,20.2 Basic Concepts Related to Wounds,Common Types of Wounds,nonblanchable erythema where prolonged pressure has occurred.
CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE,20.2 Basic Concepts Related to Wounds,Common Types of Wounds,Nonblanchable erythema is a medical term used to describe skin
CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE,20.2 Basic Concepts Related to Wounds,Common Types of Wounds,redness that does not turn white when pressed.
CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE,20.2 Basic Concepts Related to Wounds,Common Types of Wounds,•  Stage 2 pressure injuries are partial-thickness loss of skin with

CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE,20.2 Basic Concepts Related to Wounds,Common Types of Wounds,intact or ruptured blister. Stage 2 pressure injuries heal by
CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE,20.2 Basic Concepts Related to Wounds,Common Types of Wounds,reepithelialization and not by granulation tissue formation.
CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE,20.2 Basic Concepts Related to Wounds,Common Types of Wounds,•  Stage 3 pressure injuries are full-thickness tissue loss in which fat is

CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT,23.2 IV Therapy Basics,Primary IV Fluid Infusion,•  Isotonic fluids are typically administered for fluid and electrolyte
CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT,23.2 IV Therapy Basics,Primary IV Fluid Infusion,replacement. Isotonic fluids have a similar concentration to the solutes
CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT,23.2 IV Therapy Basics,Primary IV Fluid Infusion,"contained in blood, so they do not cause the osmotic movement of"
CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT,23.2 IV Therapy Basics,Primary IV Fluid Infusion,fluid into or out of the patient’s individual cells. An example of isotonic
CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT,23.2 IV Therapy Basics,Primary IV Fluid Infusion,fluid is 0.9% normal saline.
CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT,23.2 IV Therapy Basics,Primary IV Fluid Infusion,•  Hypertonic fluids have a higher concentration of solutes than blood.
CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT,23.2 IV Therapy Basics,Primary IV Fluid Infusion,They are typically used in critical care situations to treat hyponatremia
CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT,23.2 IV Therapy Basics,Primary IV Fluid Infusion,and avoid pulmonary edema by relying on osmosis to help remove
CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT,23.2 IV Therapy Basics,Primary IV Fluid Infusion,excess fluid. An example of a hypertonic fluid is dextrose 5% in 0.9%
CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT,23.2 IV Therapy Basics,Primary IV Fluid Infusion,•  Hypotonic fluids have a lower concentration of solutes than blood. The
CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT,23.2 IV Therapy Basics,Primary IV Fluid Infusion,goal of hypotonic fluid administration is to move fluids into a patient’s
CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT,23.2 IV Therapy Basics,Primary IV Fluid Infusion,cells due to osmosis. Hypotonic solutions are commonly used when a
CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT,23.2 IV Therapy Basics,Primary IV Fluid Infusion,patient has severe intracellular dehydration such as during diabetic
CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT,23.2 IV Therapy Basics,Primary IV Fluid Infusion,ketoacidosis. An example of hypotonic fluid is 0.45% normal saline (1/
