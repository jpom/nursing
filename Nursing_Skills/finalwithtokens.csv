CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY 1.1 General Survey Introduction,"Assessment According to the ANA, assessment includes collecting âpertinent data,
including but not limited to, demographics, social determinants of health,
health disparities, and physical, functional, psychosocial, emotional,
cognitive, sexual, cultural, age-related, environmental, spiritual/
transpersonal, and economic assessments in a systematic, ongoing
process with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and
Patient data is considered either subjective or objective, and it can be
collected from multiple sources.
Subjective Assessment Data
Subjective data is information obtained from the patient and/or family
members and offers important cues from their perspectives. When
documenting subjective data, it should be in quotation marks and start
with verbiage such as, âThe patient reportsâ¦â or âThe patientâs wife
statesâ¦â  It is vital for the nurse to establish rapport with a patient to obtain
accurate, valuable subjective data regarding the mental, emotional, and
spiritual aspects of their condition.
Example. An example of documented subjective data obtained from a
patient assessment is, âThe patient reports pain severity of 2 on a 1-10
scale.â Additionally, if you create an inference, then that data is considered
subjective. For example, documenting an inference, such as âThe patient
appears anxious,â is subjective data.
There are two types of subjective information, primary and secondary.
Primary data is information provided directly by the patient. Patients are
the best source of information about their bodies and feelings, and the
nurse who actively listens to a patient will often learn valuable information
while also promoting a sense of well-being. Information collected from a
family member, chart, or other sources is known as secondary data.
Family members can provide important information, especially for infants
and children or when the patient is unable to speak for themselves.
Objective Assessment Data
Objective data is anything that you can observe through your senses of
hearing, sight, smell, and touch while assessing the patient. Objective data
is reproducible, meaning another person can easily obtain the same data.
Examples of objective data are vital signs, physical examination findings,
and laboratory results.
Example. An example of documented objective data is, âThe patientâs
radial pulse is 58 and regular, and their skin feels warm and dry.â","CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY 1.1 General Survey Introduction Assessment According to the ANA, assessment includes collecting âpertinent data,

CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY 1.1 General Survey Introduction,"Sources of Assessment Data Assessment data is collected in three ways: during a focused interview,
during physical examination, or while reviewing laboratory and diagnostic
test results.
Interviewing
Interviewing includes asking the patient questions, listening, and
observing verbal and nonverbal communication. Reviewing the chart prior
to interviewing the patient eliminates redundancy in the interview
process and allows the nurse to hone in on the most significant areas of
concern or need for clarification. However, if information in the chart does
not make sense or is incomplete, the nurse should use the interview
process to verify data with the patient.
When beginning an interview, it may be helpful to start with questions
related to the patientâs medical diagnoses to gather information about
how they have affected the patientâs functioning, relationships, and
lifestyle. Listen carefully and ask for clarification when something isnât
clear to you. Patients may not volunteer important information because
and active listening, you may discover valuable cues that are important to
provide safe, quality nursing care. Sometimes nursing students can feel
uncomfortable with having difficult conversations or asking personal
questions because of generational or other differences. Donât shy away
from asking about information that is important to know for safe patient
care. Most patients will be grateful that you cared enough to ask and
listen.
Be alert and attentive to how the patient answers questions, as well as
when they do not answer a question. Nonverbal communication and body
language can be cues to important information that requires further
investigation. A keen sense of observation is important. To avoid making
inappropriate inferences, the nurse should validate any cues. For example,
a nurse may make an inference that a patient is depressed when the
patient avoids making eye contact during an interview. However, upon
further questioning, the nurse may discover that the patientâs cultural
background believes direct eye contact to be disrespectful and this is why
they are avoiding eye contact.  Read more information about
communicating with patients in the âCommunicationâ chapter of the
Open RN Nursing Fundamentals book.
Physical Examination
Physical examination is a systematic data collection method of the body
that uses the techniques of inspection, auscultation, palpation, and
percussion. Inspection is the observation of a patientâs anatomical
structures. Auscultation is listening to sounds, such as heart, lung, and
bowel sounds, created by organs using a stethoscope. Palpation is the use
of touch to evaluate organs for size, location, or tenderness. Percussion is
an advanced physical examination technique where body parts are
tapped with fingers to determine their size and if fluid is present. See
Figure 1.2
for an image of a nurse performing a physical examination.
findings as part of the nursing process. Collection of physical examination
data can be delegated to Licensed Practical Nurses/Licensed Vocational
Nurses (LPNs/LVNs), or measurements such as vital signs and weight may
be delegated to Unlicensed Assistive Personnel (UAP) when it is
appropriate to do so. However, the RN remains responsible for analyzing
the findings.
Assessment data is documented in the patientâs electronic medical record
(EMR), an electronic version of the patientâs medical chart.
Reviewing Laboratory and Diagnostic Test Results
Reviewing laboratory and diagnostic test results is an important
component of the assessment phase of the nursing process and provides
relevant and useful information related to the needs of the patient.
Understanding how normal and abnormal results affect patient care is
important when implementing the nursing care plan and administering
prescriptions.

CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY 1.2 Initiating Patient Interaction,"Hand Hygiene and Infection Prevention Before initiating care with a patient, hand hygiene is required and a risk
assessment should be performed to determine the need for personal
protective equipment (PPE).  This is important for protection of both
patient and nurse.
Hand Hygiene
Using hand hygiene is a simple but effective way to prevent infection
when performed correctly and at the appropriate times when providing
patient care. See Figure 1.3.
for an image about hand hygiene from the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
Use the hyperlinks provided below to
read more information and watch a video about effective handwashing.
â¢  In general, hand sanitizers are as effective as washing with soap and
water and are less drying to the skin. When using hand sanitizer, use
enough gel to cover both hands and rub for approximately 20
seconds, coating all surfaces of both hands until your hands feel dry.
Go directly to the patient without putting your hands into pockets or
touching anything else.
â¢  Be sure to wash with soap and water if your hands are visibly soiled or
the patient has diarrhea from suspected or confirmed C. Difficile (C-
diff).
â¢  Clean all areas of the hands including the front and back, the
fingertips, the thumbs, and between fingers.
â¢  Gloves are not a substitute for cleaning your hands. Wash your hands
after removing gloves.
â¢  Hand hygiene should be performed at these times:
â¦  Immediately before touching a patientâ¦  Before performing an aseptic task (e.g., placing an indwelling
device) or handling invasive medical devices
â¦  Before moving from working on a soiled body site to a clean body
site on the same patient
â¦  After contact with blood, body fluids, or contaminated surfacesâ¦  Immediately after glove removalâ¦  When leaving the area after touching a patient or their immediate
environment
Checklists for performing handwashing and using hand sanitizer are
located in Appendix A.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Medical asepsis is a term used to describe measures to prevent the
spread of infection in health care agencies. Performing hand hygiene at
appropriate times during patient care and applying gloves when there is
potential risk to body fluids are examples of using medical asepsis.
Additional precautions are implemented by health care team members
when a patient has, or is suspected of having, an infectious disease. These
additional precautions are called personal protective equipment (PPE)
and are based on how an infection is transmitted, such as by contact,
droplet, or airborne routes. Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes
gowns, eyewear, face shields, and masks.  PPE is used along with
environmental controls, such as surface cleaning and disinfecting to
prevent the transmission of infection.
See Figure 1.4
for an image of
discussed in the âAseptic Techniqueâ chapter. For the purpose of this
chapter, be sure to perform a general risk assessment before entering a
patientâs room and apply the appropriate PPE as needed. This risk
assessment include:
â¢  Is there signage posted on the patientâs door that contact, droplet, or
airborne precautions are in place? If so, follow the instructions
provided.
â¢  Does this patient have a confirmed or suspected infection or
communicable disease?
â¢  Will your face, hands, skin, mucous membranes, or clothing be
potentially exposed to blood or body fluids by spray, coughing, or
sneezing?
Introducing OneselfWhen initiating care with patients, it is essential to first provide privacy,
and then introduce yourself and explain what will be occurring. Providing
privacy means taking actions such as talking with the patient privately in a
room with the door shut. A common framework used for introductions
during patient care is AIDET, a mnemonic for Acknowledge, Introduce,
Duration, Explanation, and Thank You.
â¢  Acknowledge: Greet the patient by the name documented in their
medical record. Make eye contact, smile, and acknowledge any family
or friends in the room. Ask the patient their preferred way of being
addressed (for example, âMr. Doe,â âJonathon,â or âJohnnyâ) and their
preferred pronouns (i.e., he/him, she/her or they/them), as appropriate.
â¢  Introduce: Introduce yourself by your name and role. For example, âIâm
John Doe and I am a nursing student working with your nurse to take
care of you today.â
â¢  Duration: Estimate a time line for how long it will take to complete the
task you are doing. For example, âI am here to obtain your blood
pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels. This should take
about 5 minutes.â
â¢  Explanation: Explain step by step what to expect next and answer
questions. For example, âI will be putting this blood pressure cuff on
your arm and inflating it. It will feel as if it is squeezing your arm for a
few moments.â
â¢  Thank You: At the end of the encounter, thank the patient and ask if
anything is needed before you leave. In an acute or long-term care
how to use it. If family members are present, thank them for being
there to support the patient as appropriate. For example, âThank you
for taking time to talk with me today. Is there anything I can get for
you before I leave the room? Here is the call light (Place within reach).
Press the red button if you would like to call the nurse.â","CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY 1.2 Initiating Patient Interaction Hand Hygiene and Infection Prevention Before initiating care with a patient, hand hygiene is required and a risk

read more information and watch a video about effective handwashing.
â¢  In general, hand sanitizers are as effective as washing with soap and
water and are less drying to the skin. When using hand sanitizer, use
enough gel to cover both hands and rub for approximately 20
seconds, coating all surfaces of both hands until your hands feel dry.
Go directly to the patient without putting your hands into pockets or
touching anything else.
â¢  Be sure to wash with soap and water if your hands are visibly soiled or
the patient has diarrhea from suspected or confirmed C. Difficile (C-
diff).
â¢  Clean all areas of the hands including the front and back, the
fingertips, the thumbs, and between fingers.
â¢  Gloves are not a substitute for cleaning your hands. Wash your hands
after removing gloves.
â¢  Hand hygiene should be performed at these times:
â¦  Immediately before touching a patientâ¦  Before performing an aseptic task (e.g., placing an indwelling
device) or handling invasive medical devices
â¦  Before moving from working on a soiled body site to a clean body
site on the same patient
â¦  After contact with blood, body fluids, or contaminated surfacesâ¦  Immediately after glove removalâ¦  When leaving the area after touching a patient or their immediate
environment
Checklists for performing handwashing and using hand sanitizer are
located in Appendix A.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Medical asepsis is a term used to describe measures to prevent the
spread of infection in health care agencies. Performing hand hygiene at
appropriate times during patient care and applying gloves when there is
potential risk to body fluids are examples of using medical asepsis.
Additional precautions are implemented by health care team members
when a patient has, or is suspected of having, an infectious disease. These
additional precautions are called personal protective equipment (PPE)
and are based on how an infection is transmitted, such as by contact,
droplet, or airborne routes. Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes
gowns, eyewear, face shields, and masks.  PPE is used along with
environmental controls, such as surface cleaning and disinfecting to
prevent the transmission of infection.
See Figure 1.4
for an image of
discussed in the âAseptic Techniqueâ chapter. For the purpose of this
chapter, be sure to perform a general risk assessment before entering a
patientâs room and apply the appropriate PPE as needed. This risk
assessment include:
â¢  Is there signage posted on the patientâs door that contact, droplet, or
airborne precautions are in place? If so, follow the instructions
provided.
â¢  Does this patient have a confirmed or suspected infection or
communicable disease?
â¢  Will your face, hands, skin, mucous membranes, or clothing be
potentially exposed to blood or body fluids by spray, coughing, or
sneezing?
Introducing OneselfWhen initiating care with patients, it is essential to first provide privacy,
and then introduce yourself and explain what will be occurring. Providing
privacy means taking actions such as talking with the patient privately in a
room with the door shut. A common framework used for introductions
during patient care is AIDET, a mnemonic for Acknowledge, Introduce,
Duration, Explanation, and Thank You.
â¢  Acknowledge: Greet the patient by the name documented in their
medical record. Make eye contact, smile, and acknowledge any family
or friends in the room. Ask the patient their preferred way of being
addressed (for example, âMr. Doe,â âJonathon,â or âJohnnyâ) and their
preferred pronouns (i.e., he/him, she/her or they/them), as appropriate.
â¢  Introduce: Introduce yourself by your name and role. For example, âIâm
John Doe and I am a nursing student working with your nurse to take
care of you today.â
â¢  Duration: Estimate a time line for how long it will take to complete the
task you are doing. For example, âI am here to obtain your blood
pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels. This should take
about 5 minutes.â
â¢  Explanation: Explain step by step what to expect next and answer
questions. For example, âI will be putting this blood pressure cuff on
your arm and inflating it. It will feel as if it is squeezing your arm for a
few moments.â
â¢  Thank You: At the end of the encounter, thank the patient and ask if
anything is needed before you leave. In an acute or long-term care
how to use it. If family members are present, thank them for being
there to support the patient as appropriate. For example, âThank you
for taking time to talk with me today. Is there anything I can get for
you before I leave the room? Here is the call light (Place within reach).
Press the red button if you would like to call the nurse.â",1459

CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY 1.3 Vital Signs,"Temperature Accurate temperature measurements provide information about a
patientâs health status and guide clinical decisions. Methods of measuring
body temperature vary based on the patientâs developmental age,
cognitive functioning, level of consciousness, and health status, as well as
agency policy. Common methods of temperature measurement include
oral, tympanic, axillary, and rectal routes. It is important to document the
route used to obtain a patientâs temperature because of normal variations
in temperature in different locations of the body. Body temperature is
typically measured and documented in health care agencies in degrees
Celsius (ÂºC).

be taken 15 to 25 minutes following consumption of a hot or cold beverage
or food or 5 minutes after chewing gum or smoking.
Tympanic Temperature
The tympanic temperature is typically 0.3 â 0.6Â°C higher than an oral

Axillary Temperature
The axillary method is a minimally invasive way to measure temperature
and is commonly used in children. It uses the same electronic device as an
oral thermometer (with blue coloring). However, the axillary temperature
can be as much as 1ÂºC lower than the oral temperature.
TECHNIQUERemove the probe from the device and place a probe cover (from the
attached box) on the thermometer without touching the cover with your
hands. Ask the patient to raise their arm and place the thermometer
probe in their armpit on bare skin as high up into the axilla as possible.
The probe should be facing behind the patient. Ask the patient to lower
their arm and leave the device in place until it beeps, usually about 10â20
seconds. Read the displayed results, discard the probe cover in the
garbage (without touching the cover), and then place the probe back into
the device. See Figure 1.13
for an image of an axillary temperature.
Rectal Temperature
Measuring rectal temperature is an invasive method. Some sources
suggest its use only when other methods are not appropriate. However,
when measuring infant temperature, it is considered a gold standard
because of its accuracy. The rectal temperature is usually 1ÂºC higher than
oral temperature. A rectal thermometer has red coloring to distinguish it
from an oral/axillary thermometer.
See Figure 1.14
for an image of a
rectal thermometer.
TECHNIQUEBefore taking a rectal temperature, ensure the patientâs privacy. Washyour hands and put on gloves. For infants, place them in a supine position
and raise their legs upwards toward their chest. Parents may be
encouraged to hold the infant to decrease movement and provide a sense
of safety. When taking a rectal temperature in older children and adults,
assist them into a side lying position and explain the procedure. Remove
the probe from the device and place a probe cover (from the attached
box) on the thermometer. Lubricate the cover with a water-based
lubricant, and then gently insert the probe 2â3 cm inside the anus or less,
depending on the patientâs size.
Remove the probe when the device
beeps. Read the result and then discard the probe cover in the trash can
without touching it. Cleanse the device as indicated by agency policy.
Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.

CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY 1.3 Vital Signs,"Pulse Pulse refers to the pressure wave that expands and recoils arteries when
the left ventricle of the heart contracts. It is palpated at many points
throughout the body. The most common locations to assess pulses as part
of vital sign measurement include radial, brachial, carotid, and apical areas
as indicated in Figure 1.15.
age. See Table 1.3b for normal heart rate ranges by age. It is important to
consider each patient situation when analyzing if their heart rate is within
normal range. Begin by reviewing their documented baseline heart rate.
Consider other factors if the pulse is elevated, such as the presence of pain
or crying in an infant. It is best to document the assessment when a
patient is resting and comfortable, but if this is not feasible, document the
circumstances surrounding the assessment and reassess as needed.
Table 1.3b Normal Heart Rate by Age
Pulse Characteristics
When assessing pulses, the characteristics of rhythm, rate, force, and
PULSE RHYTHMA normal pulse has a regular rhythm, meaning the frequency of the
pulsation felt by your fingers is an even tempo with equal intervals
between pulsations. For example, if you compare the palpation of pulses
to listening to music, it follows a constant beat at the same tempo that
does not speed up or slow down. Some cardiovascular conditions, such as
atrial fibrillation, cause an irregular heart rhythm. If a pulse has an
irregular rhythm, document if it is âregularly irregularâ (e.g., three regular
beats are followed by one missed and this pattern is repeated) or if it is
âirregularly irregularâ (e.g., there is no rhythm to the irregularity).
PULSE RATEThe pulse rate is counted with the first beat felt by your fingers as âOne.â It
is considered best practice to assess a patientâs pulse for a full 60 seconds,
especially if there is an irregularity to the rhythm.
PULSE FORCEThe pulse force is the strength of the pulsation felt on palpation. Pulse
force can range from absent to bounding. The volume of blood, the heartâs
functioning, and the arteriesâ elastic properties affect a personâs pulse
force.
Pulse force is documented using a four-point scale:
â¢  3+: Full, bounding
â¢  2+: Normal/strong
â¢  1+: Weak, diminished, thready
â¢  0: Absent/nonpalpable
perfusion of the limbs. The Doppler is a handheld device that allows the
examiner to hear the whooshing sound of the pulse. This device is also
commonly used when assessing peripheral pulses in the lower
extremities, such as the dorsalis pedis pulse or the posterior tibial pulse.

device.

Pulse Equality
Pulse equality refers to a comparison of the pulse forces on both sides of
the body. For example, a nurse often palpates the radial pulse on a
patientâs right and left wrists at the same time and compares if the pulse
forces are equal. However, the carotid pulses should never be palpated at
the same time because this can decrease blood flow to the brain. Pulse
equality provides data about medical conditions such as peripheral
vascular disease and arterial obstruction.
Radial Pulse
Use the pads of your first three fingers to gently palpate the radial pulse.
side of the wrist (i.e., the thumb side). Fingertips are placed close to the
flexor aspect of the wrist (i.e., where the wrist meets the hand and bends).
See Figure 1.16
for correct placement of fingers in obtaining a radial
pulse. Press down with your fingers until you can feel the pulsation, but
not so forcefully that you are obliterating the wave of the force passing
through the artery. Note that radial pulses are difficult to palpate on
newborns and children under the age of five, so the brachial or apical
pulses are typically obtained in this population.
Carotid Pulse
The carotid pulse is typically palpated during medical emergencies
because it is the last pulse to disappear when the heart is not pumping an
adequate amount of blood.
TECHNIQUELocate the carotid artery medial to the sternomastoid muscle, between
the muscle and the trachea, in the middle third of the neck. With the pads
of your three fingers, gently palpate one carotid artery at a time so as not
to compromise blood flow to the brain. See Figure 1.17
for correct
placement of fingers in a seated patient.
Brachial Pulse
A brachial pulse is typically assessed in infants and children because it can
be difficult to feel the radial pulse in these populations. If needed, a
Doppler ultrasound device can be used to obtain the pulse.
TECHNIQUEThe brachial pulse is located by feeling the bicep tendon in the area of the
antecubital fossa. Move the pads of your three fingers medially from the
tendon about 1 inch (2 cm) just above the antecubital fossa. It can be
helpful to hyperextend the patientâs arm to accentuate the brachial pulse
so that you can better feel it. You may need to move your fingers around
slightly to locate the best place to accurately feel the pulse. You typically
need to press fairly firmly to palpate the brachial pulse.
See Figure 1.18
for correct placement of fingers along the brachial artery.
Apical Pulse
The apical pulse rate is considered the most accurate pulse and is
indicated when obtaining assessments prior to administering cardiac
medications. It is obtained by listening with a stethoscope over a specific
position on the patientâs chest wall. Read more about listening to the
apical pulse and other heart sounds in the âCardiovascular Assessmentâ
chapter.
Respiratory Rate
Respiration refers to a personâs breathing and the movement of air into
and out of the lungs. Inspiration refers to the process causing air to enter
the lungs, and expiration refers to the process causing air to leave the
lungs. A respiratory cycle (i.e., one breath while measuring respiratory rate)
is one sequence of inspiration and expiration.
When obtaining a respiratory rate, the respirations are also assessed for
quality, rhythm, and rate. The quality of a personâs breathing is normally
relaxed and silent. However, loud breathing, nasal flaring, or the use of
accessory muscles in the neck, chest, or intercostal spaces indicate
respiratory distress. People experiencing respiratory distress also oftenmove into a tripod position, meaning they are leaning forward and placing
their arms or elbows on their knees or on a bedside table. If a patient is
demonstrating new signs of respiratory distress as you are obtaining their
vital signs, it is vital to immediately notify the health care provider or follow
agency protocol.
Respirations normally have a regular rhythm in children and adults who
are awake. A regular rhythm means that the frequency of the respiration
follows an even tempo with equal intervals between each respiration.
However, newborns and infants commonly exhibit an irregular respiratory
rhythm.
Normal respiratory rates vary based on age. The normal resting respiratory
rate for adults is 10â20 breaths per minute, whereas infants younger than
one year old normally have a respiratory rate of 30â60 breaths per minute.
See Table 1.3c for ranges of normal respiratory rates by age. It is also
important to consider factors such as sleep cycle, presence of pain, and
crying when assessing a patientâs respiratory rate.
Read more about assessing a patientâs respiratory status in the
âRespiratory Assessmentâ chapter.
Table 1.3c Normal Respiratory Rate by Age
Oxygen Saturation
A patientâs oxygenation status is routinely assessed using pulse oximetry,
referred to as SpO2. SpO2 is an estimated oxygenation level based on the
saturation of hemoglobin measured by a pulse oximeter. Because the
majority of oxygen carried in the blood is attached to hemoglobin within
the red blood cells, SpO2 estimates how much hemoglobin is âsaturatedâ
with oxygen. The target range of SpO2 for an adult is 94-98%. For patients
with chronic respiratory conditions, such as chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), the target range for SpO2 is often lower at
88% to 92%. Although SpO2 is an efficient, noninvasive method to assess a
patientâs oxygenation status, it is an estimate and not always accurate. For
example, if a patient is severely anemic and has a decreased level of
hemoglobin in the blood, the SpO2 reading is affected. Decreased
peripheral circulation can also cause a misleading low SpO2 level.
A pulse oximeter includes a sensor that measures light absorption of
hemoglobin. See Figure 1.19
for an image of a pulse oximeter. The sensor
can be attached to the patient using a variety of devices. For intermittent
measurement of oxygen saturation, a spring-loaded clip is attached to a
patientâs finger or toe. However, this clip is too large for use on newborns
and young children; therefore, for this population, the sensor is typically
taped to a finger or toe. An earlobe clip is another alternative for patients
who cannot tolerate the finger or toe clip or have a condition, such as
vasoconstriction and poor peripheral perfusion, that could affect the
results.
The target range of SpO2 for an adult is 94-98%. For patients with chronic
respiratory conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), the target range for SpO2 is often lower at 88% to 92%.
Read more about pulse oximetry in the âOxygen Therapyâ chapter.
TECHNIQUENail polish or artificial nails can affect the absorption of light waves from
the pulse oximeter and decrease the accuracy of the SpO2 measurement
when using a probe clipped on the finger. An alternative sensor that does
not use the finger should be used for these patients or the nail polish
should be removed. If a patientâs hands or feet are cold, it is helpful to clip
the sensor to the earlobe or tape it to the forehead.

does not speed up or slow down. Some cardiovascular conditions, such as
atrial fibrillation, cause an irregular heart rhythm. If a pulse has an
irregular rhythm, document if it is âregularly irregularâ (e.g., three regular
beats are followed by one missed and this pattern is repeated) or if it is
âirregularly irregularâ (e.g., there is no rhythm to the irregularity).
PULSE RATEThe pulse rate is counted with the first beat felt by your fingers as âOne.â It
is considered best practice to assess a patientâs pulse for a full 60 seconds,
especially if there is an irregularity to the rhythm.
PULSE FORCEThe pulse force is the strength of the pulsation felt on palpation. Pulse
force can range from absent to bounding. The volume of blood, the heartâs
functioning, and the arteriesâ elastic properties affect a personâs pulse
force.
Pulse force is documented using a four-point scale:
â¢  3+: Full, bounding
â¢  2+: Normal/strong
â¢  1+: Weak, diminished, thready
â¢  0: Absent/nonpalpable
perfusion of the limbs. The Doppler is a handheld device that allows the
examiner to hear the whooshing sound of the pulse. This device is also
commonly used when assessing peripheral pulses in the lower
extremities, such as the dorsalis pedis pulse or the posterior tibial pulse.

device.

Pulse Equality
Pulse equality refers to a comparison of the pulse forces on both sides of
the body. For example, a nurse often palpates the radial pulse on a
patientâs right and left wrists at the same time and compares if the pulse
forces are equal. However, the carotid pulses should never be palpated at
the same time because this can decrease blood flow to the brain. Pulse
equality provides data about medical conditions such as peripheral
vascular disease and arterial obstruction.
Radial Pulse
Use the pads of your first three fingers to gently palpate the radial pulse.
side of the wrist (i.e., the thumb side). Fingertips are placed close to the
flexor aspect of the wrist (i.e., where the wrist meets the hand and bends).
See Figure 1.16
for correct placement of fingers in obtaining a radial
pulse. Press down with your fingers until you can feel the pulsation, but
not so forcefully that you are obliterating the wave of the force passing
through the artery. Note that radial pulses are difficult to palpate on
newborns and children under the age of five, so the brachial or apical
pulses are typically obtained in this population.
Carotid Pulse
The carotid pulse is typically palpated during medical emergencies
because it is the last pulse to disappear when the heart is not pumping an
adequate amount of blood.
TECHNIQUELocate the carotid artery medial to the sternomastoid muscle, between
the muscle and the trachea, in the middle third of the neck. With the pads
of your three fingers, gently palpate one carotid artery at a time so as not
to compromise blood flow to the brain. See Figure 1.17
for correct
placement of fingers in a seated patient.
Brachial Pulse
A brachial pulse is typically assessed in infants and children because it can
be difficult to feel the radial pulse in these populations. If needed, a
Doppler ultrasound device can be used to obtain the pulse.
TECHNIQUEThe brachial pulse is located by feeling the bicep tendon in the area of the
antecubital fossa. Move the pads of your three fingers medially from the
tendon about 1 inch (2 cm) just above the antecubital fossa. It can be
helpful to hyperextend the patientâs arm to accentuate the brachial pulse
so that you can better feel it. You may need to move your fingers around
slightly to locate the best place to accurately feel the pulse. You typically
need to press fairly firmly to palpate the brachial pulse.
See Figure 1.18
for correct placement of fingers along the brachial artery.
Apical Pulse
The apical pulse rate is considered the most accurate pulse and is
indicated when obtaining assessments prior to administering cardiac
medications. It is obtained by listening with a stethoscope over a specific
position on the patientâs chest wall. Read more about listening to the
apical pulse and other heart sounds in the âCardiovascular Assessmentâ
chapter.
Respiratory Rate
Respiration refers to a personâs breathing and the movement of air into
and out of the lungs. Inspiration refers to the process causing air to enter
the lungs, and expiration refers to the process causing air to leave the
lungs. A respiratory cycle (i.e., one breath while measuring respiratory rate)
is one sequence of inspiration and expiration.
When obtaining a respiratory rate, the respirations are also assessed for
quality, rhythm, and rate. The quality of a personâs breathing is normally
relaxed and silent. However, loud breathing, nasal flaring, or the use of
accessory muscles in the neck, chest, or intercostal spaces indicate
respiratory distress. People experiencing respiratory distress also oftenmove into a tripod position, meaning they are leaning forward and placing
their arms or elbows on their knees or on a bedside table. If a patient is
demonstrating new signs of respiratory distress as you are obtaining their
vital signs, it is vital to immediately notify the health care provider or follow
agency protocol.
Respirations normally have a regular rhythm in children and adults who
are awake. A regular rhythm means that the frequency of the respiration
follows an even tempo with equal intervals between each respiration.
However, newborns and infants commonly exhibit an irregular respiratory
rhythm.
Normal respiratory rates vary based on age. The normal resting respiratory
rate for adults is 10â20 breaths per minute, whereas infants younger than
one year old normally have a respiratory rate of 30â60 breaths per minute.
See Table 1.3c for ranges of normal respiratory rates by age. It is also
important to consider factors such as sleep cycle, presence of pain, and
crying when assessing a patientâs respiratory rate.
Read more about assessing a patientâs respiratory status in the
âRespiratory Assessmentâ chapter.
Table 1.3c Normal Respiratory Rate by Age
Oxygen Saturation
A patientâs oxygenation status is routinely assessed using pulse oximetry,
referred to as SpO2. SpO2 is an estimated oxygenation level based on the
saturation of hemoglobin measured by a pulse oximeter. Because the
majority of oxygen carried in the blood is attached to hemoglobin within
the red blood cells, SpO2 estimates how much hemoglobin is âsaturatedâ
with oxygen. The target range of SpO2 for an adult is 94-98%. For patients
with chronic respiratory conditions, such as chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), the target range for SpO2 is often lower at
88% to 92%. Although SpO2 is an efficient, noninvasive method to assess a
patientâs oxygenation status, it is an estimate and not always accurate. For
example, if a patient is severely anemic and has a decreased level of
hemoglobin in the blood, the SpO2 reading is affected. Decreased
peripheral circulation can also cause a misleading low SpO2 level.
A pulse oximeter includes a sensor that measures light absorption of
hemoglobin. See Figure 1.19
for an image of a pulse oximeter. The sensor
can be attached to the patient using a variety of devices. For intermittent
measurement of oxygen saturation, a spring-loaded clip is attached to a
patientâs finger or toe. However, this clip is too large for use on newborns
and young children; therefore, for this population, the sensor is typically
taped to a finger or toe. An earlobe clip is another alternative for patients
who cannot tolerate the finger or toe clip or have a condition, such as
vasoconstriction and poor peripheral perfusion, that could affect the
results.
The target range of SpO2 for an adult is 94-98%. For patients with chronic
respiratory conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), the target range for SpO2 is often lower at 88% to 92%.
Read more about pulse oximetry in the âOxygen Therapyâ chapter.
TECHNIQUENail polish or artificial nails can affect the absorption of light waves from
the pulse oximeter and decrease the accuracy of the SpO2 measurement
when using a probe clipped on the finger. An alternative sensor that does
not use the finger should be used for these patients or the nail polish
should be removed. If a patientâs hands or feet are cold, it is helpful to clip
the sensor to the earlobe or tape it to the forehead.

CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY 1.4 Basic Concepts,"Primary Survey At the beginning of every shift or patient visit, nurses perform a brief
primary survey to ensure their patient is medically stable. If any signs
indicate patient distress, the provider is notified and emergency care isinitiated. For example, changes in level of consciousness or abnormal vital
signs often provide early warning signs that a patientâs condition is
deteriorating and prompt medical treatment is needed.

airway, breathing, and circulation are also quickly assessed and
emergency actions taken as needed.
In a clinic setting, the patient is observed from the time they are called
from the waiting room. Nurses observe a patientâs gait and balance as
they walk to the exam room and assess their verbal and nonverbal
communication while interacting. If signs of distress are occurring, the
nurse follows agency policy and either immediately calls a provider into
the room or initiates emergency assistance.
Mental Status
When assessing a patientâs overall mental status, it is important to
compare findings to their known baseline if this information is known or
available. Initially determine if a patient is responsive or unresponsive. Can
you awaken them and are they responding to your questions? Are they
oriented to person, place, and time, meaning can they tell you their name,
location, and the day of the week? If you are concerned about a sudden
change in a patientâs mental status, obtain emergency assistance
according to agency policy.
Airway and Breathing
Determine if the patientâs airway is open and if they are breathing
adequately. Institute emergency care for respiratory distress as needed.
See Figure 1.20
for an illustration of checking a patientâs airway, breathing,
Circulation
If a patient is not responsive, try to awaken them using a sternal rub. A
sternal rub is performed by firmly rubbing oneâs knuckles on a patientâs
sternum to try to elicit a response. If they do not respond, check the
carotid pulse and obtain emergency assistance as needed. Briefly observe
the color and moisture of their skin. Abnormal findings such as cool,

CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY 1.4 Basic Concepts,"General Appearance After ensuring your patient is medically stable by completing a primary
survey, a general survey consists of using your senses to observe a
patientâs general appearance, behavior, mobility, and communication.
Items to consider when assessing general appearance include the
following:
â¢  Signs of pain or distress: Patients may exhibit signs of pain or distressthat should be reported to the provider such as grimacing, moaning,
or increased anxiety. Set the priorities for your focused assessments
based on any signs of distress demonstrated by your patient.
â¢  Age: Observe if the patient appears their stated age. Chronic disease
can cause a patient to appear older than their age. Factors can occur
with older adults that may influence how well the patient can
participate in the assessment, such as hearing, vision, or mobility
impairments.
â¢  Body type: No patient is exactly the same; some patients are in good
physical shape and others are not. Body type can reflect nutritional
status and lifestyle choices.
â¢  Hygiene, grooming, and dress: Observe the overall cleanliness of the
poor hygiene or various disease states. Validate odors by performing
additional focused assessments as needed. Note the appearance of
the patientâs clothing; is it clean and appropriate for the season? If not,

CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY 1.4 Basic Concepts,"Behavior While observing the patient, note their behaviors during your interaction.
Consider the following items:
â¢  Affect and mood: People express their mood through facial
expressions, eye contact, what they do, and what they say. Eye contact
is commonly used to judge a personâs mood because people who are
feeling down or depressed commonly avoid eye contact. However, be
aware that cultural beliefs may also affect the use of eye contact.
Affect refers to the outward display of oneâs emotional state. For
example, a patient with a  âflat affectâ refers to very few facial
expressions being displayed to indicate emotion, which is often
associated with depression. If the patientâs mood or behavior seems
inappropriate for their current situation, make a note of that as well.
For example, a patient in an usually elated mood in a situation when
most people would be seriously concerned can be a symptom of
mental illness.
â¢  Family dynamics: If other family members are accompanying the
patient, note the characteristics of their interactions. Family dynamics
are the patterns of interactions between family members that
influence family structure, hierarchy, roles, values, and behaviors.
Family dynamics have a strong impact on the way children see
themselves, others, and their world. They can also impact the lifestyles
daily living and health care.
â¢  Signs of patient abuse: Abuse occurs in many different forms such as
physical, emotional, mental, verbal, sexual, economic, or financial.
Most states mandate nurses and other health care professionals to
report suspected child and elder abuse to the proper authorities.
Observe if your patient seems fearful, excessively quiet, or has physical
signs of abuse, such as bruising or burn marks. If you suspect abuse,
attempt to interview the patient alone. Promptly report your concerns
according to agency policy and state mandates.
â¢  Substance use disorder: Approach your patient in a caring and
nonjudgmental way, but be aware that unusual signs or behaviors can
be indicators of substance use disorder. For example, if a patientâs
pupils are unusually dilated or constricted, this can be a sign of
substance use disorder. Contact the provider with concerns about
substance use disorder.

CHAPTER 1 GENERAL SURVEY 1.4 Basic Concepts,"Height, Weight, and BMI Height and weight can be used as a guide to reflect the patientâs general
health. Weight is routinely assessed during all health care visits. Infants
and children are measured to assess their growth and development.
Hospitalized patients often have daily weights assessed to monitor for
changes in their medical condition. Document findings based on agency
policy. For example, in some agencies, height is documented in
centimeters and weight is documented in kilograms. Recall that one inch
is equivalent to 2.5 centimeters and 1 kilogram is equivalent to 2.2 pounds.
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a standardized reference range that is used to
analyze a patientâs weight status and provides a representation of body
fat. However, it is important to note that BMI may not be accurate for
athletes with increased muscle mass, people with edema or dehydration,
or older adults who have lost a significant amount of muscle mass. See a
BMI table in Figure 1.24.
To use the BMI table, find the height in inches in
the left column, move across the row to closest weight, and then read the
BMI where the column and row intersect. For example, a person who is 5â²
9â³ tall is 69 inches. If the patient weighs 155 pounds, the BMI is 23. BMI
indicating a healthy weight is between 18.5 to 24.9.
BMI can also be calculated using the formula of BMI = kg/m2 (weight inkilograms divided by height in meters squared).
Underweight: Below 18.5 kg/m2
Healthy weight: 18.6 to 24.9 kg/m2

Life Span Considerations During a General SurveyAssessment
CHILDRENWhen performing a general survey on a child, be aware of their
developmental stages to establish expectations for normal findings. Use a
calm and gentle tone to establish trust. Demonstrations on dolls or stuffed
animals before performing procedures are often helpful. Be aware that the
parents of toddlers and school-aged children will likely provide most of the
information during an assessment.
ADOLESCENTSAdolescents may refrain from sharing important information related to
their care in front of their parents, especially regarding high-risk behaviors
such as smoking, alcohol or drug use, sexual activity, or suicidal thoughts.
It is often helpful to allow time to interview the adolescent privately, in
addition to gathering information when the parent is present.
OLDER ADULTSRecognize normal changes associated with aging when performing a
general survey. If your patient wears glasses or hearing aids, be sure theyare in place before asking questions. You may need to allow for extra time
for your assessment, depending on the abilities of your patient. If an older
adult is unable to communicate effectively, nurses may also consult a
variety of sources such as family members and electronic medical records
for more information.
Cultural Adaptations During a General SurveyAssessment
Adapt your communication during a general survey assessment to your
patientâs cultural beliefs and values. For example, some individuals believe
that direct eye contact with authorities is considered disrespectful and
avoid eye contact. Other individuals may nod to indicate they are listening
but this does not mean they are in agreement with what you are saying.
Some patients prefer that a same sex individual perform care.

as âthe protection, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities,
prevention of illness and injury, facilitation of healing, alleviation of
advocacy in the care of individuals, families, groups, communities, and

Simply put, nurses treat human responses to health
problems and/or life processes. Nurses look at each person holistically,
including emotional, spiritual, psychosocial, and physical health needs.
They also consider problems and issues that the person experiences as a
part of a family and a community. To collect detailed information about a
patientâs human response to illness and life processes, nurses perform a
health history. A health history is part of the Assessment phase of the
nursing process. It consists of using directed, focused interview questions
and open-ended questions to obtain symptoms and perceptions from the
patient about their illnesses, functioning, and life processes. While
obtaining a health history, the nurse is also simultaneously performing a
general survey. Visit the âGeneral Survey Assessmentâ chapter more

CHAPTER 2 HEALTH HISTORY 2.2 Health History Basic Concepts,"Subjective Versus Objective Data Obtaining a patientâs health history is a component of the Assessment
phase of the nursing process. Information obtained while performing a
health history is called subjective data. Subjective data is information
obtained from the patient and/or family members and can provide
important cues about functioning and unmet needs requiring assistance.
Subjective data is considered a symptom because it is something the
patient reports. When documenting subjective data in a progress note, it
should be included in quotation marks and start with verbiage such as,
âThe patient reportsâ¦â or âThe patientâs wife statesâ¦â An example of
subjective data is when the patient reports, âI feel dizzy.â
A patient is considered the primary source of subjective data. Secondary
sources of data include information from the patientâs chart, family
members, or other health care team members. Patients are oftenaccompanied by their care partners. Care partners are family and friends
who are involved in helping to care for the patient. For example, parents
are care partners for children; spouses are often care partners for each
other, and adult children are often care partners for their aging parents.
When obtaining a health history, care partners may contribute important
information related to the health and needs of the patient. If data is
gathered from someone other than the patient, the nurse should
document where the information is obtained.
Objective data is information observed through your senses of hearing,
sight, smell, and touch while assessing the patient. Objective data is
obtained during the physical examination component of the assessment
process. Examples of objective data are vital signs, physical examination
findings, and laboratory results. An example of objective data is recording
a blood pressure reading of 140/86. Subjective data and objective data are
often recorded together during an assessment. For example, the
symptom the patient reports,  âI feel itchy all over,â is documented in
association with the sign of an observed raised red rash located on the
upper back and chest.
Addressing Barriers and Adapting CommunicationIt is vital to establish rapport with a patient before asking questions about
sensitive topics to obtain accurate data regarding the mental, emotional,
and spiritual aspects of a patientâs condition. When interviewing a patient,
also consider the patientâs developmental status and level of
understanding. Ask one question at a time and allow adequate time for
the patient to respond. If the patient does not provide an answer even
with additional time, try rephrasing the question in a different way for
improved understanding.
If any barriers to communication exist, adapt your communication to that
patientâs specific needs. For more information about potential
communication barriers and strategies for adapting communication, visitthe âCommunicationâ chapter in Open RN Nursing Fundamentals.","CHAPTER 2 HEALTH HISTORY 2.2 Health History Basic Concepts Subjective Versus Objective Data Obtaining a patientâs health history is a component of the Assessment

CHAPTER 2 HEALTH HISTORY 2.2 Health History Basic Concepts,"Cultural Safety It is important to conduct a health history in a culturally safe manner.
Cultural safety refers to the creation of safe spaces for patients to interact
with health professionals without judgment or discrimination. Focus on
factors related to a personâs cultural background that may influence their
health status. It is helpful to use an open-ended question to allow the
patient to share what they believe to be important. For example, ask âI am
interested in your cultural background as it relates to your health. Can you
share with me what is important to know about your cultural background
as part of your health care?â
If a patientâs primary language is not English, it is important to obtain a
medical translator, as needed, prior to initiating the health history. The
patientâs family member or care partner should not interpret for the
patient. The patient may not want their care partner to be aware of their
health problems or their care partner may not be familiar with correct
medical terminology that can result in miscommunication.","CHAPTER 2 HEALTH HISTORY 2.2 Health History Basic Concepts Cultural Safety It is important to conduct a health history in a culturally safe manner.

questions for pain and other symptoms using the PQRSTU mnemonic.
Table 2.5b Sample PQRSTU Focused Questions for Pain and Other
Symptoms
While interviewing a patient about their chief complaint, use open-ended
questions to allow the patient to elaborate on information that further
improves your understanding of their health concerns. If their answers do
not seem to align, continue to ask focused questions to clarify information.
For example, if a patient states that âthe pain is tolerableâ but also rates
the pain as a â7â on a 0-10 pain scale, these answers do not align, and the
nurse should continue to use follow-up questions using the PQRSTUframework. For example, upon further questioning the patient explains
they rate the pain as a â7â in their knee when participating in physical
therapy exercises, but currently feels the pain is tolerable while resting in
bed. This additional information will help the nurse customize
interventions for effective treatment.","CHAPTER 2 HEALTH HISTORY 2.5 Reason for Seeking Health Care Chief Complaint After identifying the reason why the patient is seeking health care,

CHAPTER 2 HEALTH HISTORY 2.8 Functional Health and Activities of Daily Living,"Elimination Elimination refers to the removal of waste products through the urine and
stool. Health care professionals refer to urinating as voiding and stool
elimination as having a bowel movement. Familiar terminology may need
to be used with patients, such as âpeeâ and âpoop.â  Constipation
commonly occurs in hospitalized patients, so it is important to assess the
date of their last bowel movement and monitor the frequency, color, and
consistency of their stool. Assess urine concentration, frequency, and odor,
especially if concerned about urinary tract infection, incontinence, or
infection. Findings that require further investigation include dysuria (pain
or difficulty upon urination), blood in the stool, melena (black, tarry stool),
constipation, diarrhea, or excessive laxative use.
Life Span Considerations
When assessing elimination, the types of questions asked and the level of
detail depends on the developmental age and health of the patient.

stand up, walk). Activity and exercise refer to informal and/or formal
activity (e.g., walking, swimming, yoga, strength training). In addition to
assessing the amount of exercise, it is also important to assess activity
because some people may not engage in exercise but have an active
lifestyle (e.g., walk to school or work in a physically demanding job).
Findings that require further investigation include insufficient aerobic

CHAPTER 2 HEALTH HISTORY 2.8 Functional Health and Activities of Daily Living,"Sexuality â Reproduction Sexuality and sexual relations are an aspect of health that can be affected
by illness, aging, and medication. This category includes a personâs gender
identity and sexual orientation, as well as reproductive issues. It involves a
combination of emotional connection, physical companionship (holding
hands, hugging, kissing) and sexual activity that impact oneâs feeling of
health.
The Joint Commission has defined terms to use when caring for diverse
patients. Gender identity is a personâs basic sense of being male, female,
or other gender.
Gender expression are characteristics in appearance,
personality, and behavior that are culturally defined as masculine or
an individualâs physical and/or emotional attraction to the same and/or
opposite gender.
LGBT is an acronym standing for the lesbian, gay,
bisexual, and transgender population. It is an umbrella term that generally
refers to a group of people who are diverse in gender identity and sexual
orientation. It is important to provide a safe environment to discuss health
issues because the LGBT population experiences higher rates of smoking,
alcohol use, substance abuse, HIV and other STD infections, anxiety,
depression, suicidal ideation and attempts, and eating disorders as a result
of stigma and marginalization.

CHAPTER 2 HEALTH HISTORY 2.8 Functional Health and Activities of Daily Living,"Coping-Stress Tolerance Individuals experience stress that can lead to dysfunction if not managed
in a healthy manner. Throughout life, healthy and unhealthy coping
strategies are learned. Coping strategies are behaviors used to manage
anxiety. Effective strategies control anxiety and lead to problem solving
but ineffective strategies can lead to abuse of food, tobacco, alcohol, or
drugs.
Nurses teach and reinforce effective coping strategies.
Substance Use and Abuse
Alcohol, tobacco products, marijuana, and drugs are often used as
ineffective coping strategies. It is important to use a nonjudgmental
approach when assessing a patientâs use of substances so they do not feel
stigmatized. Substance abuse can affect people of all ages. Make a
distinction between use and abuse as you assess frequency of use and
patterns of behavior. Substance abuse often causes disruption in everyday
function (e.g., loss of employment, deterioration of relationships, or
precarious living circumstances) because of dependence on a substance.
Action is needed if patients indicate that they have a problem with
substance use or show signs of dependence, addiction, or binge
drinking.

health care and can also provide strength and comfort to individuals. It is
common for a personâs spirituality and values to be influenced by religious
faith. A value is an accepted principle or standard of an individual or
group. A belief is something accepted as true with a sense of certainty.
Spirituality is a way of living that comes from a set of values and beliefs
that are important to a person. The Joint Commission asks health care
professionals to respect patientsâ cultural and personal values, beliefs, and
preferences and accommodate patientsâ rights to religious and other
spiritual services.
When performing an assessment, use open-ended
questions to allow the patient to share values and beliefs they believe are
important. For example, ask, âI am interested in your spiritual and religious
beliefs and how they relate to your health. Can you share with me any
spiritual beliefs or religious practices that are important to you during your

CHAPTER 2 HEALTH HISTORY 2.8 Functional Health and Activities of Daily Living,"Self-Perception and Self-Concept The focus of this category is on the subjective thoughts, feelings, and
attitudes of a patient about themself. Self-concept refers to all the
knowledge a person has about themself that makes up who they are (i.e.,
their identity). Self-esteem refers to a personâs self-evaluation of these
items as being worthy or unworthy. Body image is a mental picture of
oneâs body related to appearance and function. It is best to assess these
items toward the end of the interview because you will have already
collected data that contributes to an understanding of the patientâs self-
concept. Factors that influence a patientâs self-concept vary from person
to person and include elements of life they value, such as talents,
education, accomplishments, family, friends, career, financial status,
spirituality, and religion.
The self-perception and self-concept category
also focuses on feelings and mood states such as happiness, anxiety, hope,
power, anger, fear, depression, and control.
Life Span Considerations
Some individuals are at risk for problems with self-perception and self-
concept. Be sensitive to cues when assessing individuals with
characteristics such as uncertainty regarding a medical diagnosis or
surgery, significant personal loss, history of abuse or neglect, loss of body
part or function, or history of substance abuse.
Violence and Trauma
There are many types of violence that a person may experience, including
neglect or physical, emotional, mental, sexual, or financial abuse. You are
well as suspected cases of elder abuse. At any time, if you or the patient is
in immediate danger, follow agency policy and procedure.
Trauma results from violence or other distressing events in a life.
Collaborative intervention with the patient is required when violence and
trauma are identified. People respond in different ways to trauma. It is
important to use a trauma-informed approach when caring for patients
who have experienced trauma. For example, a patient may respond to the
traumatic situation in a way that seems unfitting (such as with laughter,
ambivalence, or denial). This does not mean the patient is lying but can be
a symptom of trauma. To reduce the effects of trauma, it is important to
implement collaborative interventions to support patients who have
experienced trauma.
Loss of Body Part
A person can have negative feelings or perceptions about the
characteristics, function, or limits of a body part as a result of a medical
condition, surgery, trauma, or mental condition. Pay attention to cues,
such as neglect of a body part or negative comments about a body part,
and use open-ended questions to obtain additional information.
Mental Health
Mental health is frequently underscreened and unaddressed in health
care. The mental health of all patients should be assessed, even if they
changes in condition are quickly noticed and treatment implemented.
Mental health includes emotional and psychological symptoms that can
affect a patientâs day-to-day ability to function. The World Health
Organization (2014) defines mental health as âa state of well-being in
which every individual realizes their own potential, can cope with normal
stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a
contribution to their community.â
Mental illness includes conditions
diagnosed by a health care provider, such as depression, anxiety,
addiction, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and others.
Mental illness can disrupt everyday functioning and affect a personâs
employment, education, and relationships.
It is helpful to begin this component of a mental health assessment with a
statement such as, âMental health is an important part of our lives, so I ask
all patients about their mental health and any concerns or questions they
may have.â
Be attentive of critical findings that require intervention. For
example, if a patient talks about feeling hopeless or depressed, it is
important to screen for suicidal thinking. Begin with an open-ended
question, such as, âHave you ever felt like hurting yourself?â If the patient
responds with a âYes,â then progress with specific questions that assess
the immediacy and the intensity of the feelings. For example, you may say,
âTell me more about that feeling. Have you been thinking about hurting
yourself today? Have you put together a plan to hurt yourself?â When
assessing for suicidal thinking, be aware that a patient most at risk is
someone who has a specific plan about self-harm and can specify how
and when they will do it. They are particularly at risk if planning self-harm
within the next 48 hours. The age of the patient is not a factor in this
determination of risk. If you believe the patient is at high risk, do not leave
the patient alone. Collaborate with them regarding an immediate plan for
emergency care.","CHAPTER 2 HEALTH HISTORY 2.8 Functional Health and Activities of Daily Living Self-Perception and Self-Concept The focus of this category is on the subjective thoughts, feelings, and

CHAPTER 3 BLOOD PRESSURE 3.2 Blood Pressure Basics,"What is Blood Pressure? A blood pressure reading is the measurement of the force of blood against
the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood through the body. It is
reported in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). This pressure changes in the
arteries when the heart is contracting compared to when it is resting and
filling with blood. Blood pressure is typically expressed as the reflection of
two numbers, systolic pressure and diastolic pressure. The systolic blood
pressure is the maximum pressure on the arteries during systole, the
phase of the heartbeat when the ventricles contract. Systole causes the
ejection of blood out of the ventricles and into the aorta and pulmonary
arteries. The diastolic blood pressure is the resting pressure on the
arteries during diastole, the phase between each contraction of the heart
when the ventricles are filling with blood.
Blood pressure measurements are obtained using a stethoscope and a
sphygmomanometer, also called a blood pressure cuff. To obtain a
manual blood pressure reading, the blood pressure cuff is placed around a
patientâs extremity, and a stethoscope is placed over an artery. For most
blood pressure readings, the cuff is usually placed around the upper arm,
and the stethoscope is placed over the brachial artery. The cuff is inflated
deflated slowly. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that
the blood pressure cuff be inflated at least 30 mmHg above the point at
which the radial pulse is no longer palpable. The first appearance of
sounds, called Korotkoff sounds, are noted as the systolic blood pressure
reading. Korotkoff sounds are named after Dr. Korotkoff, who first
discovered the audible sounds of blood pressure when the arm is
constricted.Korotkoff sounds disappear. The last Korotkoff sounds reflect the diastolic

3 It is important to deflate the cuff slowly at no
noted promptly and that the reading is accurate. Blood pressure readings
are documented as systolic blood pressure/diastolic pressure, for example,
120/80 mmHg.
Abnormal blood pressure readings can signify an area of concern and a
need for intervention. Normal adult blood pressure is less than 120/80
mmHg. Hypertension is the medical term for elevated blood pressure
readings of 130/80 mmHg or higher. See Table 4.2 for blood pressure
categories according to the 2017 American College of Cardiology and
American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guidelines.
Prior to
diagnosing a person with hypertension, the health care provider will
calculate an average blood pressure based on two or more blood pressure
readings obtained on two or more occasions.
Hypotension is the medical term for low blood pressure readings less than
90/60 mmHg.
Hypotension can be caused by dehydration, bleeding,
can be of significant concern because of the potential lack of perfusion to
critical organs when blood pressures are low. Orthostatic hypotension is a
drop in blood pressure that occurs when moving from a lying down
(supine) or seated position to a standing (upright) position. When
measuring blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension is defined as a
decrease in blood pressure by at least 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg
diastolic within three minutes of standing. When a person stands, gravity
moves blood from the upper body to the lower limbs. As a result, there is a
temporary reduction in the amount of blood in the upper body for the
heart to pump, which decreases blood pressure. Normally, the body
quickly counteracts the force of gravity and maintains stable blood
pressure and blood flow. In most people, this transient drop in blood
pressure goes unnoticed. However, some patients with orthostatic
hypotension can experience light-headedness, dizziness, or fainting.  This
is a significant safety concern because of the increased risk of falls and
injury, particularly in older adults.

can be of significant concern because of the potential lack of perfusion to
critical organs when blood pressures are low. Orthostatic hypotension is a
drop in blood pressure that occurs when moving from a lying down
(supine) or seated position to a standing (upright) position. When
measuring blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension is defined as a
decrease in blood pressure by at least 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg
diastolic within three minutes of standing. When a person stands, gravity
moves blood from the upper body to the lower limbs. As a result, there is a
temporary reduction in the amount of blood in the upper body for the
heart to pump, which decreases blood pressure. Normally, the body
quickly counteracts the force of gravity and maintains stable blood
pressure and blood flow. In most people, this transient drop in blood
pressure goes unnoticed. However, some patients with orthostatic
hypotension can experience light-headedness, dizziness, or fainting.  This
is a significant safety concern because of the increased risk of falls and
injury, particularly in older adults.

Automatic blood pressure monitors are often used in health care settings
to efficiently measure blood pressure for multiple patients or to repeatedly
measure a single patientâs blood pressure at a specific frequency such as
every 15 minutes. See Figure 3.3
for an image of an automatic blood

appropriately position the patient and place the correctly sized blood
pressure cuff on their bare arm or other extremity. Press the start button
on the monitor. The cuff will automatically inflate and then deflate at a
rate of 2 mmHg per second. The monitor digitally displays the blood
pressure reading when done. If the blood pressure reading is unexpected,
it is important to follow up by obtaining a reading using a manual blood
pressure cuff. Additionally, automatic blood pressure monitors should not
be used if the patient has a rapid or irregular heart rhythm, such as atrial
fibrillation, or has tremors as it may lead to an inaccurate reading.","CHAPTER 3 BLOOD PRESSURE 3.2 Blood Pressure Basics Equipment to Measure Blood Pressure Manual Blood Pressure

their usual blood pressure reading or reviewing previous records in their
chart. It is also important to determine if there are any arm restrictions
such as those due to a fistula, mastectomy, stroke, or IV line before
measuring blood pressure. See Table 3.3a for sample interview questions
associated with the subjective assessment of blood pressure.

CHAPTER 3 BLOOD PRESSURE 3.3 Blood Pressure Assessment,"Objective Assessment Inspection
Before obtaining a blood pressure reading, it is important to inspect and
consider conditions that would prevent the use of a blood pressure cuff,
such as a history of clots or presence of current clots, lymphedema,
wounds, a fistula, or current IV access lines. If these conditions exist, obtain
the blood pressure in an alternative extremity.
Life Span Considerations
Children
Blood pressure measurement is not routinely performed on children
under the age of 3 unless there are cardiac concerns.
Older Adults
Blood pressure measurements are sometimes difficult to hear in older
adults. For patients who are clinically stable and Korotkoff sound
auscultation is difficult, doppler auscultation may be helpful.
Clinical Tips
Blood pressure assessment should be completed after the patient has
rested for a minimum of five minutes. If the patient has ingested caffeine
should be documented with the reading.
There are times when it is difficult to auscultate Korotkoff sounds. As a
result, the care team must decide what alternate measures could be
performed to obtain accurate blood pressure results. For patients who are
critically ill or hemodynamically unstable, an arterial line may be placed
directly into an artery to measure blood pressure. This is an invasive
procedure and is not used for routine monitoring.

CHAPTER 4 ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE 4.2 Aseptic Technique Basic Concepts,"Standard Versus Transmission-Based Precautions Standard Precautions
Standard precautions are used when caring for all patients to prevent
health care associated infections. According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), standard precautions are âthe minimum
infection prevention practices that apply to all patient care, regardless of
suspected or confirmed infection status of the patient, in any setting
where health care is delivered.â
They are based on the principle that all
blood, body fluids (except sweat), nonintact skin, and mucous membranes
may contain transmissible infectious agents. These standards reduce the
risk of exposure for the health care worker and protect the patient from
potential transmission of infectious organisms.
Current standard precautions according to the CDC (2019) include the
following:
1.  Appropriate hand hygiene
2.  Use of personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, gowns, masks,
eyewear) whenever infectious material exposure may occur
precautions when indicated
4.  Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette
5.  Proper handling and cleaning of environment, equipment, and
devices
6.  Safe handling of laundry
7.  Sharps safety (i.e., engineering and work practice controls)
8.  Aseptic technique for invasive nursing procedures such as parenteral
medication administration
Each of these standard precautions is described in more detail in the
following subsections.
Transmission-Based Precautions
In addition to standard precautions, transmission-based precautions are
used for patients with documented or suspected infection, or colonization,
of highly-transmissible or epidemiologically-important pathogens.
Epidemiologically-important pathogens include, but are not limited to,
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), C. difficile (C-diff), Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE),
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), measles, and tuberculosis (TB). For
patients with these types of pathogens, standard precautions are used
along with specific transmission-based precautions.
There are three categories of transmission-based precautions: contact
precautions, droplet precautions, and airborne precautions.
Transmission-based precautions are used when the route(s) of
transmission is (are) not completely interrupted using standard
precautions alone. Some diseases, such as tuberculosis, have multiple
routes of transmission so more than one transmission-based precautionscategory must be implemented. See Table 4.2 outlining the categories of
transmission precautions with associated PPE and other precautions.
When possible, patients with transmission-based precautions should be
placed in a single occupancy room with dedicated patient care
equipment (e.g., blood pressure cuffs, stethoscope, thermometer).
Transport of the patient and unnecessary movement outside the patient
room should be limited. However, when transmission-based precautions
are implemented, it is also important for the nurse to make efforts to
counteract possible adverse effects of these precautions on patients, such
as anxiety, depression, perceptions of stigma, and reduced contact with
clinical staff.
Table 4.2  Transmission-Based Precautions
PATIENT TRANSPORTSeveral principles are used to guide transport of patients requiring
transmission-based precautions. In the inpatient and residential settings,
these principles include the following:
â¢  Limiting transport for essential purposes only, such as diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures that cannot be performed in the patientâs
room
â¢  Using appropriate barriers on the patient consistent with the route
and risk of transmission (e.g., mask, gown, covering the affected areas
when infectious skin lesions or drainage is present)
â¢  Notify other health care personnel involved in the care of the patient
of the transmission-based precautions. For example, when
transporting the patient to radiology, inform the radiology technician
of the precautions.
Appropriate Hand HygieneHand hygiene is the single most important practice to reduce the
transmission of infectious agents in health care settings and is an
essential element of standard precautions.
5 Routine handwashing during
appropriate moments is a simple and effective way to prevent infection.
However, it is estimated that health care professionals, on average,The
properly clean their hands less than 50% of the time it is indicated.
Joint Commission, the organization that sets evidence-based standards of
care for hospitals, recently updated its hand hygiene standards in 2018 to
promote enforcement. If a Joint Commission surveyor witnesses an
individual failing to properly clean their hands when it is indicated, a
deficiency will be cited requiring improvement by the agency. This
deficiency could potentially jeopardize a hospitalâs accreditation status
and their ability to receive payment for patient services. Therefore, it is
essential for all health care workers to ensure they are using proper hand
hygiene at the appropriate times.
There are several evidence-based guidelines for performing appropriate
hand hygiene. These guidelines include frequency of performing hand
hygiene according to the care circumstances, solutions used, and
technique performed. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory
Committee (HICPAC) recommends health care personnel perform hand
hygiene at specific times when providing care to  patients. These
moments are often referred to as the âFive Moments for Hand Hygiene.â
See Figures 4.1
and 4.2
for an illustration and application of the five
moments of hand hygiene. The five moments of hand hygiene are as
follows:
â¢  Immediately before touching a patient
â¢  Before performing an aseptic task or handling invasive devices
â¢  Before moving from a soiled body site to a clean body site on a patient
â¢  After touching a patient or their immediate environment
â¢  After contact with blood, body fluids, or contaminated surfaces (with
or without glove use)
â¢  Immediately after glove removal
When performing hand hygiene, washing with soap and water, or an
approved alcohol-based hand rub solution that contains at least 60%
alcohol, may be used. Unless hands are visibly soiled, an alcohol-based
hand rub is preferred over soap and water in most clinical situations due
to evidence of improved compliance. Hand rubs are also preferred
because they are generally less irritating to health care workerâs hands.
eliminate some types of germs, such as Clostridium difficile (C-diff).
When using the alcohol-based handrub method, the CDC recommends
the following steps. See Figure 4.3
for a handrub poster created by the
World Health Organization.
â¢  Apply product to the palm of one hand in an amount that will cover all
surfaces.
â¢  Rub hands together, covering all the surfaces of the hands, fingers,
and wrists until the hands are dry. Surfaces include the palms and
fingers, between the fingers, the backs of the hands and fingers, the
fingertips, and the thumbs.
â¢  The process should take about 20 seconds, and the solution should be
dry.
When washing with soap and water, the CDC recommends using the
following steps. See Figure 4.4
for an image of a handwashing poster
created by the World Health Organization.
â¢  Wet hands with warm or cold running water and apply facility-
approved soap.
â¢  Lather hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Use the same
technique as the handrub process to clean the palms and fingers,
between the fingers, the backs of the hands and fingers, the
fingertips, and the thumbs.
â¢  Scrub thoroughly for at least 20 seconds.
â¢  Rinse hands well under clean, running water.
â¢  Dry the hands using a clean towel or disposable toweling.
â¢  Use a clean paper towel to shut off the faucet.
By performing hand hygiene at the proper moments and using
appropriate techniques, you will ensure your hands are safe and you are
not transmitting infectious organisms to yourself or others.

and risk of transmission (e.g., mask, gown, covering the affected areas
when infectious skin lesions or drainage is present)
â¢  Notify other health care personnel involved in the care of the patient
of the transmission-based precautions. For example, when
transporting the patient to radiology, inform the radiology technician
of the precautions.
Appropriate Hand HygieneHand hygiene is the single most important practice to reduce the
transmission of infectious agents in health care settings and is an
essential element of standard precautions.
5 Routine handwashing during
appropriate moments is a simple and effective way to prevent infection.
However, it is estimated that health care professionals, on average,The
properly clean their hands less than 50% of the time it is indicated.
Joint Commission, the organization that sets evidence-based standards of
care for hospitals, recently updated its hand hygiene standards in 2018 to
promote enforcement. If a Joint Commission surveyor witnesses an
individual failing to properly clean their hands when it is indicated, a
deficiency will be cited requiring improvement by the agency. This
deficiency could potentially jeopardize a hospitalâs accreditation status
and their ability to receive payment for patient services. Therefore, it is
essential for all health care workers to ensure they are using proper hand
hygiene at the appropriate times.
There are several evidence-based guidelines for performing appropriate
hand hygiene. These guidelines include frequency of performing hand
hygiene according to the care circumstances, solutions used, and
technique performed. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory
Committee (HICPAC) recommends health care personnel perform hand
hygiene at specific times when providing care to  patients. These
moments are often referred to as the âFive Moments for Hand Hygiene.â
See Figures 4.1
and 4.2
for an illustration and application of the five
moments of hand hygiene. The five moments of hand hygiene are as
follows:
â¢  Immediately before touching a patient
â¢  Before performing an aseptic task or handling invasive devices
â¢  Before moving from a soiled body site to a clean body site on a patient
â¢  After touching a patient or their immediate environment
â¢  After contact with blood, body fluids, or contaminated surfaces (with
or without glove use)
â¢  Immediately after glove removal
When performing hand hygiene, washing with soap and water, or an
approved alcohol-based hand rub solution that contains at least 60%
alcohol, may be used. Unless hands are visibly soiled, an alcohol-based
hand rub is preferred over soap and water in most clinical situations due
to evidence of improved compliance. Hand rubs are also preferred
because they are generally less irritating to health care workerâs hands.
eliminate some types of germs, such as Clostridium difficile (C-diff).
When using the alcohol-based handrub method, the CDC recommends
the following steps. See Figure 4.3
for a handrub poster created by the
World Health Organization.
â¢  Apply product to the palm of one hand in an amount that will cover all
surfaces.
â¢  Rub hands together, covering all the surfaces of the hands, fingers,
and wrists until the hands are dry. Surfaces include the palms and
fingers, between the fingers, the backs of the hands and fingers, the
fingertips, and the thumbs.
â¢  The process should take about 20 seconds, and the solution should be
dry.
When washing with soap and water, the CDC recommends using the
following steps. See Figure 4.4
for an image of a handwashing poster
created by the World Health Organization.
â¢  Wet hands with warm or cold running water and apply facility-
approved soap.
â¢  Lather hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Use the same
technique as the handrub process to clean the palms and fingers,
between the fingers, the backs of the hands and fingers, the
fingertips, and the thumbs.
â¢  Scrub thoroughly for at least 20 seconds.
â¢  Rinse hands well under clean, running water.
â¢  Dry the hands using a clean towel or disposable toweling.
â¢  Use a clean paper towel to shut off the faucet.
By performing hand hygiene at the proper moments and using
appropriate techniques, you will ensure your hands are safe and you are
not transmitting infectious organisms to yourself or others.

CHAPTER 4 ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE 4.2 Aseptic Technique Basic Concepts,"Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) includes gloves, gowns, face shields,
goggles, and masks used to prevent the spread of infection to and from
patients and health care providers. Depending on the anticipated
exposure, PPE may include the use of gloves, a fluid-resistant gown,
goggles or a face shield, and a mask or respirator. When used for a patient
with transmission-based precautions, PPE supplies are typically stored in
an isolation cart next to the patientâs room, and a card is posted on the
door alerting staff and visitors to precautions needed before entering the
room.
Gloves
Gloves protect both patients and health care personnel from exposure to
infectious material that may be carried on the hands. Gloves are used to
prevent contamination of health care personnel hands during activities
such as the following:
â¢  anticipating direct contact with blood or body fluids, mucous
membranes, nonintact skin, and other potentially infectious material
â¢  having direct contact with patients who are colonized or infected with
pathogens transmitted by the contact route, such as Vancomycin-
resistant enterococci (VRE), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus (MRSA), and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
â¢  handling or touching visibly or potentially contaminated patient care
equipment and environmental surfaces
Nonsterile disposable medical gloves for routine patient care are made of
a variety of materials, such as latex, vinyl, and nitrile. Many people are
allergic to latex, so be sure to check for latex allergies for the patient and
other health care professionals. See Figure 4.5
for an image of nonsterile
medical gloves in various sizes in a health care setting. At times, gloves
may need to be changed when providing care to a single patient to
prevent cross-contamination of body sites. It is also necessary to change
gloves if the patient interaction requires touching portable computer
keyboards or other mobile equipment that is transported from room to
room. Discarding gloves between patients is necessary to prevent
transmission of infectious material. Gloves must not be washed for
subsequent reuse because microorganisms cannot be reliably removed
from glove surfaces and continued glove integrity cannot be ensured.
Figure 4.5 Nonsterile Medical GlovesWhen gloves are worn in combination
with other PPE, they are put on last. Gloves that fit snugly around the wrist
should be used in combination with isolation gowns because they will
cover the gown cuff and provide a more reliable continuous barrier for the
arms, wrists, and hands.
Gloves should be removed properly to prevent contamination. See Figure
4.6
for an illustration of properly removing gloves. Hand hygiene should
be performed following glove removal to ensure the hands will not carry
potentially infectious material that might have penetrated through
unrecognized tears or contaminated the hands during glove removal. One
method for properly removing gloves includes the following steps:
â¢  Grasp the outside of one glove near the wrist. Do not touch your skin.
â¢  Peel the glove away from your body, pulling it inside out.
â¢  Hold the removed glove in your gloved hand.
â¢  Put your fingers inside the glove at the top of your wrist and peel off
the second glove.
â¢  Turn the second glove inside out while pulling it away from your body,
leaving the first glove inside the second.
â¢  Dispose of the gloves safely. Do not reuse.
â¢  Perform hand hygiene immediately after removing the gloves.

Gowns
Isolation gowns are used to protect the health care workerâs arms and
exposed body areas and to prevent contamination of their clothing with
blood, body fluids, and other potentially infectious material. Isolation
gowns may be disposable or washable/reusable. See Figure 4.7
for an
image of a nurse wearing an isolation gown along with goggles and a
respirator. When using standard precautions, an isolation gown is worn
only if contact with blood or body fluid is anticipated. However, when
contact transmission-based precautions are in place, donning of both
gown and gloves upon room entry is indicated to prevent unintentional
Gowns are usually the first piece of PPE to be donned. Isolation gowns
should be removed before leaving the patient room to prevent possible
contamination of the environment outside the patientâs room. Isolation
gowns should be removed in a manner that prevents contamination of
clothing or skin. The outer, âcontaminated,â side of the gown is turned
inward and rolled into a bundle, and then it is discarded into a designated
container to contain contamination. See more information about putting
on and removing PPE in the subsection below.
Masks
The mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes are susceptible
portals of entry for infectious agents. Masks are used to protect these sites
from entry of large infectious droplets. See Figure 4.8
for an image of
nurse wearing a surgical mask. Masks have three primary purposes in
health care settings:
â¢  Used by health care personnel to protect them from contact with
infectious material from patients (e.g., respiratory secretions and
sprays of blood or body fluids), consistent with standard precautions
and droplet transmission precautions
â¢  Used by health care personnel when engaged in procedures requiring
sterile technique to protect patients from exposure to infectious
agents potentially carried in a health care workerâs mouth or nose
â¢  Placed on coughing patients to limit potential dissemination of
infectious respiratory secretions from the patient to others in public
areas (i.e., respiratory hygiene)
Masks may be used in combination with goggles or a face shield to
provide more complete protection for the face. Masks should not be
confused with respirators used during airborne transmission-based
precautions to prevent inhalation of small, aerosolized infectious
droplets.
It is important to properly wear and remove masks to avoid
contamination. See Figure 4.9
for CDC face mask recommendations for
health care personnel.
Goggles/Face Shields
Eye protection chosen for specific work situations (e.g., goggles or face
shields) depends upon the circumstances of exposure, other PPE used,
and personal vision needs. Personal eyeglasses are not considered
adequate eye protection. See Figure 4.10
for an image of a health care
professional wearing a face shield along with a N95 respirator.
Respirators and PAPRs
Respiratory protection used during airborne transmission precautions
requires the use of special equipment. Traditionally, a fitted respirator
mask with N95 or higher filtration has been worn by health care
professionals to prevent inhalation of small airborne infectious particles. A
user-seal check (formerly called a âfit checkâ) should be performed by thewearer of a respirator each time a respirator is donned to minimize air
leakage around the facepiece.
A newer piece of equipment used for respiratory protection is the
powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). A PAPR is an air-purifying
respirator that uses a blower to force air through filter cartridges or
canisters into the breathing zone of the wearer. This process creates an air
flow inside either a tight-fitting facepiece or loose-fitting hood or helmet,
providing a higher level of protection against aerosolized pathogens, such
as COVID-19,  than a N95 respirator. See Figure 4.11
for an example of
PAPR in use.
The CDC currently recommends N95 or higher level respirators for
personnel exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed tuberculosis
procedures such as respiratory-tract suctioning.
It is important to apply,
wear, and remove respirators appropriately to avoid contamination. See
Figure 4.12
for CDC recommendations when wearing disposable
respirators.
How to Put On (Don) PPE Gear
Follow agency policy for donning PPE according to transmission-based
precautions. More than one donning method for putting on PPE may be
acceptable. The CDC recommends the following steps for donning PPE:
â¢  Identify and gather the proper PPE to don. Ensure the gown size is
correct.
â¢  Perform hand hygiene using hand sanitizer.
â¢  Put on the isolation gown. Tie all of the ties on the gown. Assistance
may be needed by other health care personnel to tie back ties.
â¢  Based on specific transmission-based precautions and agency policy,
put on a mask or N95 respirator. The top strap should be placed on the
crown (top) of the head, and the bottom strap should be at the base of
the neck. If the mask has loops, hook them appropriately around your
ears. Masks and respirators should extend under the chin, and both
your mouth and nose should be protected. Perform a user-seal check
each time you put on a respirator. If the respirator has a nosepiece, it
should be fitted to the nose with both hands, but it should not be
bent or tented. Masks typically require the nosepiece to be pinched to
fit around the nose, but do not pinch the nosepiece of a respirator
with one hand. Do not wear a respirator or mask under your chin or
store it in the pocket of your scrubs between patients.
â¢  Put on a face shield or goggles when indicated. When wearing an N95
respirator with eye protection, select eye protection that does not
affect the fit or seal of the respirator and one that does not affect the
position of the respirator. Goggles provide excellent protection for the
eyes, but fogging is common. Face shields provide full-face coverage.
â¢  Put on gloves. Gloves should cover the cuff (wrist) of the gown.
â¢  You may now enter the patientâs room.

contamination of the hands. Gloves can be removed using more than
one technique (e.g., glove-in-glove or bird beak).

ties can be broken rather than untied; do so in a gentle manner and
avoid a forceful movement. Reach up to the front of your shoulders
and carefully pull the gown down and away from your body. Rolling
the gown down is also an acceptable approach. Dispose of the gown
in a trash receptacle. If it is a washable gown, place it in the specified
laundry bin for PPE in the room.

â¢  Perform hand hygiene.
â¢  Remove the face shield or goggles. Carefully remove the face shield or
goggles by grabbing the strap and pulling upwards and away from

â¢  Remove and discard the respirator or face mask. Do not touch the
front of the respirator or face mask. Remove the bottom strap by
touching only the strap and bringing it carefully over the head. Grasp
the top strap and bring it carefully over the head, and then pull the
respirator away from the face without touching the front of the

CHAPTER 4 ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE 4.2 Aseptic Technique Basic Concepts,"Environmental Measures Routine cleaning and disinfecting surfaces in patient-care areas are part of
standard precautions. The cleaning and disinfecting of all patient-care
areas are important for frequently touched surfaces, especially those
closest to the patient that are most likely to be contaminated (e.g.,
bedrails, bedside tables, commodes, doorknobs, sinks, surfaces, and
equipment in close proximity to the patient).
Medical equipment and instruments/devices must also be cleaned to
prevent patient-to-patient transmission of infectious agents. For example,
stethoscopes should be cleaned before and after use for all patients.
Patients who have transmission-based precautions should have dedicated
medical equipment that remains in their room (e.g., stethoscope, blood
pressure cuff, thermometer). When dedicated equipment is not possible,
such as a unit-wide bedside blood glucose monitor, disinfection after each
patientâs use should be performed according to agency policy.
Disposal of Contaminated Waste
Medical waste requires careful disposal according to agency policy. The
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established
measures for discarding regulated medical waste items to protect the
workers who generate medical waste, as well as those who manage the
waste from point of generation to disposal. Contaminated waste is placed
in a leak-resistant biohazard bag, securely closed, and placed in a labeled,
leakproof, puncture-resistant container in a storage area. Sharps
containers are used to dispose of sharp items such as discarded tubes
with small amounts of blood, scalpel blades, needles, and syringes.
Sharps Safety
Injuries due to needles and other sharps have been associated with
transmission of blood-borne pathogens (BBP), including hepatitis B,
hepatitis C, and HIV to health care personnel. The prevention of sharps
injuries is an essential element of standard precautions and includes
measures to handle needles and other sharp devices in a manner that will
prevent injury to the user and to others who may encounter the device
during or after a procedure. The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard is a
regulation that prescribes safeguards to protect workers against health
hazards related to blood-borne pathogens. It includes work practice
controls, hepatitis B vaccinations, hazard communication and training,
plans for when an employee is exposed to a BBP, and record keeping.
When performing procedures that include needles or other sharps,
dispose of these items immediately in FDA-cleared sharps disposal
containers. Additionally, to prevent needlestick injuries, needles and other
contaminated sharps should not be recapped. See Figure 4.14
for an
image of a sharps disposal container. FDA-cleared sharps disposal
containers are made from rigid plastic and come marked with a line that
indicates when the container should be considered full, which means itâs
time to dispose of the container. When a sharps disposal container is
about three-quarters full, follow agency policy for proper disposal of the
container.
If you are stuck by a needle or other sharps or are exposed to blood or
other potentially infectious materials in your eyes, nose, mouth, or on
wound with soap and water. Report the incident immediately to your
instructor or employer and seek immediate medical attention according
to agency and school policy.
Textiles and Laundry
Soiled textiles, including bedding, towels, and patient or resident clothing
may be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms. However, the risk
of disease transmission is negligible if they are handled, transported, and
laundered in a safe manner. Follow agency policy for handling soiled
laundry using standard precautions. Key principles for handling soiled
â¢  Do not shake items or handle them in any way that may aerosolize
infectious agents.
â¢  Avoid contact of oneâs body and personal clothing with the soiled
items being handled.
â¢  Place soiled items in a laundry bag or designated bin in the patientâs
room before transporting to a laundry area. When laundry chutes are
used, they must be maintained to minimize dispersion of aerosols
from contaminated items.","CHAPTER 4 ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE 4.2 Aseptic Technique Basic Concepts Environmental Measures Routine cleaning and disinfecting surfaces in patient-care areas are part of
standard precautions. The cleaning and disinfecting of all patient-care
areas are important for frequently touched surfaces, especially those
closest to the patient that are most likely to be contaminated (e.g.,
bedrails, bedside tables, commodes, doorknobs, sinks, surfaces, and
equipment in close proximity to the patient).
Medical equipment and instruments/devices must also be cleaned to
prevent patient-to-patient transmission of infectious agents. For example,
stethoscopes should be cleaned before and after use for all patients.
Patients who have transmission-based precautions should have dedicated
medical equipment that remains in their room (e.g., stethoscope, blood
pressure cuff, thermometer). When dedicated equipment is not possible,
such as a unit-wide bedside blood glucose monitor, disinfection after each
patientâs use should be performed according to agency policy.
Disposal of Contaminated Waste
Medical waste requires careful disposal according to agency policy. The
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established
measures for discarding regulated medical waste items to protect the
workers who generate medical waste, as well as those who manage the
waste from point of generation to disposal. Contaminated waste is placed
in a leak-resistant biohazard bag, securely closed, and placed in a labeled,
leakproof, puncture-resistant container in a storage area. Sharps
containers are used to dispose of sharp items such as discarded tubes
with small amounts of blood, scalpel blades, needles, and syringes.
Sharps Safety
Injuries due to needles and other sharps have been associated with
transmission of blood-borne pathogens (BBP), including hepatitis B,
hepatitis C, and HIV to health care personnel. The prevention of sharps
injuries is an essential element of standard precautions and includes
measures to handle needles and other sharp devices in a manner that will
prevent injury to the user and to others who may encounter the device
during or after a procedure. The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard is a
regulation that prescribes safeguards to protect workers against health
hazards related to blood-borne pathogens. It includes work practice
controls, hepatitis B vaccinations, hazard communication and training,
plans for when an employee is exposed to a BBP, and record keeping.
When performing procedures that include needles or other sharps,
dispose of these items immediately in FDA-cleared sharps disposal
containers. Additionally, to prevent needlestick injuries, needles and other
contaminated sharps should not be recapped. See Figure 4.14
for an
image of a sharps disposal container. FDA-cleared sharps disposal
containers are made from rigid plastic and come marked with a line that
indicates when the container should be considered full, which means itâs
time to dispose of the container. When a sharps disposal container is
about three-quarters full, follow agency policy for proper disposal of the
container.
If you are stuck by a needle or other sharps or are exposed to blood or
other potentially infectious materials in your eyes, nose, mouth, or on
wound with soap and water. Report the incident immediately to your
instructor or employer and seek immediate medical attention according
to agency and school policy.
Textiles and Laundry
Soiled textiles, including bedding, towels, and patient or resident clothing
may be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms. However, the risk
of disease transmission is negligible if they are handled, transported, and
laundered in a safe manner. Follow agency policy for handling soiled
laundry using standard precautions. Key principles for handling soiled
â¢  Do not shake items or handle them in any way that may aerosolize
infectious agents.
â¢  Avoid contact of oneâs body and personal clothing with the soiled
items being handled.
â¢  Place soiled items in a laundry bag or designated bin in the patientâs
room before transporting to a laundry area. When laundry chutes are
used, they must be maintained to minimize dispersion of aerosols
from contaminated items.",952
CHAPTER 4 ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE 4.3 Aseptic Technique,"Principles of Aseptic Non-Touch Technique Aseptic non-touch technique (ANTT) is the most commonly used aseptic
technique framework in the health care setting and is considered a global
standard. There are two types of ANTT: surgical-ANTT (sterile technique)
and standard-ANTT.
Aseptic non-touch technique starts with a few concepts that must be
understood before it can be applied. For all invasive procedures, the
âANTT-approachâ identifies key parts and key sites throughout the
preparation and implementation of the procedure. A key part is any sterile
part of equipment used during an aseptic procedure, such as needle hubs,
syringe tips, needles, and dressings. A key site is any nonintact skin,
potential insertion site, or access site used for medical devices connected
to the patients. Examples of key sites include open wounds and insertion
sites for intravenous (IV) devices and urinary catheters.
ANTT includes four underlying principles to keep in mind while
performing invasive procedures:
â¢  Always wash hands effectively.
â¢  Never contaminate key parts.
â¢  Touch non-key parts with confidence.
â¢  Take appropriate infective precautions.","CHAPTER 4 ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE 4.3 Aseptic Technique Principles of Aseptic Non-Touch Technique Aseptic non-touch technique (ANTT) is the most commonly used aseptic

CHAPTER 4 ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE 4.3 Aseptic Technique,"Technique When planning for any procedure, careful thought and preparation of
many infection control factors must be considered beforehand. While
keeping standard precautions in mind, identify anticipated key sites and
key parts to the procedure. Consider the degree to which the environment
must be managed to reduce the risk of infection, including the expected
degree of contamination and hazardous exposure to the clinician. Finally,
review the expected equipment needed to perform the procedure and
the level of key part or key site handling. See Table 4.3 for an outline of
infection control measures when performing a procedure.

CHAPTER 4 ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE 4.3 Aseptic Technique,"Use of Gloves and Sterile Gloves There are two different levels of medical-grade gloves available to health
care providers: clean (exam) gloves and sterile (surgical) gloves. Generally
speaking, clean gloves are used whenever there is a risk of contact with
body fluids or contaminated surfaces or objects. Examples include starting
an intravenous access device or emptying a urinary catheter collection
bag. Alternatively, sterile gloves meet FDA requirements for sterilization
and are used for invasive procedures or when contact with a sterile site,
tissue, or body cavity is anticipated. Sterile gloves are used in these
instances to prevent transient flora and reduce resident flora
contamination during a procedure, thus preventing the introduction of
pathogens. For example, sterile gloves are required when performing
central line dressing changes, insertion of urinary catheters, and during
invasive surgical procedures. See Figure 4.15

CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS 5.2 Math Basic Concepts,"Measuring Devices Depending on the type and amount of medication that is being
administered, there are several devices used for measuring and
administering medications.
A medication cup that is composed of plastic or paper is used to hold and
dispense oral medications to a patient. A paper cup is used to administer
nonliquid medications, such as tablets or capsules. A plastic medication
cup is used to dispense both liquid and nonliquid medications, and
calibrated cups are also used to measure liquid medications prior to
administration. Calibrated medication cups have labelled measurements
such as ounces (oz), cubic centimeters (cc), milliliters (mL), teaspoons (tsp),
and tablespoons (Tbs). See Figure 5.1
for an image of a calibrated
medication cup.
Oral syringes are used to administer liquid medications via the oral route,
especially to children, because they allow for precise measurement of

Syringes are used when administering medications through the
parenteral route (i.e., intradermally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or
intravenously). Syringes used for injections are available in many sizes and
are selected by the nurse based on the type of injection and the type of
medication administered. Common syringe sizes range from 1 mL to 60
mL. See Figure 5.3
for an image comparing various sizes of syringes.
Syringes are calibrated based on the volume they hold. For example, a
1-mL syringe is calibrated in hundredths and a 3-mL syringe is calibrated
in tenths. Syringes that hold larger volumes, such as 5-, 10-, and 12-mL
syringes are usually calibrated in fifths (two tenths). Large syringes, such
as 60-mL syringes, are calibrated in whole numbers.

nonliquid medications, such as tablets or capsules. A plastic medication
cup is used to dispense both liquid and nonliquid medications, and
calibrated cups are also used to measure liquid medications prior to
administration. Calibrated medication cups have labelled measurements
such as ounces (oz), cubic centimeters (cc), milliliters (mL), teaspoons (tsp),
and tablespoons (Tbs). See Figure 5.1
for an image of a calibrated
medication cup.
Oral syringes are used to administer liquid medications via the oral route,
especially to children, because they allow for precise measurement of

Syringes are used when administering medications through the
parenteral route (i.e., intradermally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or
intravenously). Syringes used for injections are available in many sizes and
are selected by the nurse based on the type of injection and the type of
medication administered. Common syringe sizes range from 1 mL to 60
mL. See Figure 5.3
for an image comparing various sizes of syringes.
Syringes are calibrated based on the volume they hold. For example, a
1-mL syringe is calibrated in hundredths and a 3-mL syringe is calibrated
in tenths. Syringes that hold larger volumes, such as 5-, 10-, and 12-mL
syringes are usually calibrated in fifths (two tenths). Large syringes, such
as 60-mL syringes, are calibrated in whole numbers.
Special syringes are used to administer insulin and are calibrated in units.4 for an image of an insulin syringe. Insulin syringes are easily

CHAPTER 5 MATH CALCULATIONS 5.7 Conversions,"Ounces to Milliliters When caring for patients, nurses often need to convert between ounces
and milliliters. Although these equivalencies are typically memorized, letâs
start with a simple problem of converting ounces to milliliters to
demonstrate the technique of dimensional analysis.
Practice Problem #1: Ounces to Millileters
A patient drank an 8 ounce can of juice. The nurse must document the
intake in milliliters. How many milliliters of juice did the patient drink?
Here is an example of how to solve this conversion problem using
dimensional analysis.
1. Identify the unit being solved for as the goal. In this example, we want to
convert the patientâs oral intake from ounces to milliliters, so we are
solving for milliliters (mL):
2. Set up the numerator in the first fraction to match the desired unit to
be solved. In this case, we want to know how many milliliters should be
documented, so mL is placed in the numerator. To complete the fraction,
we add information already known. In this example, we know that 30 mL
is equivalent to 1 ounce, so 30 mL is added to the numerator and 1 ounce is
added to the denominator:
3. Add the  second fraction to the equation. When using dimensional
analysis, fractions are set up so the same units are diagonal from each
other so they cancel each other out, leaving the desired unit. For this
problem, the second fraction is set up to include ounces in the numerator
so that it will cancel out ounces in the denominator of the first fraction. â8â
is then added to the numerator because we know from the problem that
the patient consumed 8 ounces. â1â is then added to the denominator
because the purpose of the second fraction is to cancel out units:
4. Cancel out similar units that are diagonal to each other. After canceling
out ounces, we are left with our desired units of mL:
5. Multiply across the numerators and then multiply across the
denominators:
6. Divide the numerator by the denominator to get the final answer with
the desired goal unit:
Practice Problem #2: Ounces to Millileters
In a similar manner, dimensional analysis can be used to calculate a
patientâs total liquid intake on their meal tray. See Figure 5.6
for an
example of a patientâs meal tray in a hospital setting.
Sample scenario: Your patient consumed 8 ounces of coffee, 4 ounces of
orange juice, and 4 ounces of milk. How many milliliters of intake will you
document?
Calculate using dimensional analysis.
1. Add up the total intake in ounces:
2. Start by identifying mL as the goal unit for which you are solving. In this
case, we want to know the number of milliliters:
3. Create the first fraction by matching milliliters in the numerator. Then,
using known equivalency that 30 mL is equal to 1 ounce, place 30 in the
numerator and 1 ounce in the denominator:
4. Create the second fraction to cross out units. You know you want to
cross out ounces, so place ounces in the numerator. Then, add the known
amount of ounces consumed, which was 16:
5. Multiply across the numerators and then the denominators. Divide the
numerator by the denominator of 1 for the final answer in mL:

CHAPTER 6 NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 6.2 Basic Neurological Concepts,"Functions of the Nervous System The nervous system receives information about the environment around
us (sensation) and generates responses to that information (motor
responses). The process of integration combines sensory perceptions and
higher cognitive functions such as memories, learning, and emotion while
producing a response.
Sensation
Sensation is defined as receiving information about the environment. The
major senses are taste, smell, touch, sight, and hearing. Additional sensory
stimuli are also provided from inside the body, such as the stretch of an
organ wall or the concentration of certain ions in the blood.
Response
by sensory nerves. For example, withdrawing a hand from a hot stove is an
example of a response to a painfully hot stimulus.  Responses can be
classified by those that are voluntary (such as contraction of a skeletal
muscle) and those that are involuntary (such as contraction of smooth
muscle in the intestine). Voluntary responses are governed by the somatic
nervous system, and involuntary responses are governed by the
autonomic nervous system.
Integration
Integration occurs when stimuli received by sensory nerves are
communicated to the nervous system and the information is processed,
leading to the generation of a conscious response. Consider this example
of sensory integration. A batter in a baseball game does not automatically
swing when they see the baseball thrown to them by the pitcher. First, the
trajectory of the ball and its speed will need to be considered before
creating the motor response of a swing. Then, integration will occur as the
batter generates a conscious decision of whether to swing or not.  Perhaps
the count is three balls and one strike, and the batter decides to let this
pitch go by in the hope of getting a walk to first base. Perhaps the batter is
afraid to strike out and doesnât swing, or maybe the batter learned the
pitcherâs nonverbal cues the previous time at bat and is confident to take
a swing at an anticipated fast ball.  All of these considerations are included
as part of the batterâs integration response and the higher level
functioning that occurs in the cerebral cortex.","CHAPTER 6 NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 6.2 Basic Neurological Concepts Functions of the Nervous System The nervous system receives information about the environment around

CHAPTER 6 NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 6.3 Neurological Exam,"Types of Neurological Examinations The type of neurological exam performed is based on the patientâs reason
for seeking care, their current medical condition, and the practice setting.
Routine Exam
Routine neurological exams performed by registered nurses during their
daily clinical practice include assessing mental status and level of
consciousness, pupillary response, motor strength, sensation, and gait.
The Glasgow Coma Scale is also frequently used to objectively monitor
level of consciousness in patients with neurological damage such as a
head injury or cerebrovascular accident (i.e., stroke).
Comprehensive
A comprehensive neurologic exam is performed on patients with a
neurological concern. This exam is more extensive and may be performed
in specialty settings or by advanced practice nurses. In addition to the
components included in a routine neurological exam, the examiner may
also assess cranial nerves, detailed cerebellar function, deep tendon
reflexes, and complete a Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE).
Periodic Reevaluation
Periodic reevaluations are performed by registered nurses when the
patient has experienced an acute injury or illness causing neurological
deficits that require frequent monitoring for change in condition. For
example, a patient admitted to the hospital for an acute cerebrovascular
accident (i.e., stroke) will have their neurological status rechecked and
documented frequently according to agency policy. See Figure 6.8
of a
nurse assessing a patientâs neurological status in an intensive care unit.","CHAPTER 6 NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 6.3 Neurological Exam Types of Neurological Examinations The type of neurological exam performed is based on the patientâs reason

CHAPTER 6 NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 6.4 Assessing Mental Status,"Level of Consciousness Level of consciousness refers to a patientâs level of arousal and alertness.Assessing a patientâs orientation to time, place, and person is a quick
indicator of cognitive functioning. Level of consciousness is typically
evaluated on admission to a facility to establish a patientâs baseline status
and then frequently monitored every shift for changes in condition.
To
assess a patientâs orientation status, ask, âCan you tell me your name?
Where are you? What day is it?â If the patient is unable to recall a specific
date, it may be helpful to ask them the day of the week, the month, or the
season to establish a baseline of their awareness level.
A normal level of orientation is typically documented as, âPatient is alert
and oriented to person, place, and time,â or by the shortened phrase, âAlert
and oriented x 3.â
If a patient is confused, an example of documentation
is, âPatient is alert and oriented to self, but disoriented to time and place.â
There are many screening tools that can be used to further objectively
assess a patientâs mental status and cognitive impairment. Common
screening tools used frequently by registered nurses to assess mental
status include the Glasgow Coma Scale, the National Institutes of Health
Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE).
Glasgow Coma Scale
The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a standardized tool used to objectively
assess and continually monitor a patientâs level of consciousness when
damage has occurred, such as after a head injury or a cerebrovascular
for an image of the Glasgow Coma Scale.accident (stroke). See Figure 6.9
Three primary areas assessed in the GCS include eye opening, verbal
response, and motor response. Scores are added from these three
categories to assign a patientâs level of responsiveness. Scores ranging
from 15 or higher are classified as the best response, less than 8 is
classified as comatose, and 3 or less is classified as unresponsive.
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a standardized
tool that is commonly used to assess patients suspected of experiencing
an acute cerebrovascular accident (i.e., stroke).
The three most predictive
findings that occur during an acute stroke are facial drooping, arm drift/
weakness, and abnormal speech. Use the following hyperlink to view the
stroke scale.
A commonly used mnemonic regarding assessment of individuals
suspected of experiencing a stroke is âBEFAST.â  BEFAST stands for
Balance, Eyes, Face, Arm, and Speech Test.
â¢  B: Does the person have a sudden loss of balance?
â¢  E: Has the person lost vision in one or both eyes?
â¢  F: Does the personâs face look uneven?
â¢  A: Is one arm weak or numb?
â¢  S: Is the personâs speech slurred? Are they having trouble speaking or
seem confused?
â¢  T: Time to call for assistance immediately
Mini-Mental Status Exam
The Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) is commonly used to assess a
patientâs cognitive status when there is a concern of cognitive
impairment. The MMSE is sensitive and specific in detecting delirium anddementia in patients at a general hospital and in residents of long-term
care facilities.
Delirium is acute, reversible confusion that can be caused
by several medical conditions such as fever, infection, and lack of
oxygenation. Dementia is chronic, irreversible confusion and memory loss
that impacts functioning in everyday life.
Prior to administering the MMSE, ensure the patient is wearing their
glasses and/or hearing aids, if needed.
A patient can score up to 30 points
by accurately responding and following directions given by the examiner.
A score of 24-30 indicates no cognitive impairment, 18-23 indicates mild
cognitive impairment, and a score less than 18 indicates severe cognitive
impairment. See Figure 6.10
for an image of one of the questions on the
MMSE regarding interlocking pentagons.","CHAPTER 6 NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 6.4 Assessing Mental Status Level of Consciousness Level of consciousness refers to a patientâs level of arousal and alertness.Assessing a patientâs orientation to time, place, and person is a quick

Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE).
Glasgow Coma Scale
The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a standardized tool used to objectively
assess and continually monitor a patientâs level of consciousness when
damage has occurred, such as after a head injury or a cerebrovascular
for an image of the Glasgow Coma Scale.accident (stroke). See Figure 6.9
Three primary areas assessed in the GCS include eye opening, verbal
response, and motor response. Scores are added from these three
categories to assign a patientâs level of responsiveness. Scores ranging
from 15 or higher are classified as the best response, less than 8 is
classified as comatose, and 3 or less is classified as unresponsive.
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a standardized
tool that is commonly used to assess patients suspected of experiencing
an acute cerebrovascular accident (i.e., stroke).
The three most predictive
findings that occur during an acute stroke are facial drooping, arm drift/
weakness, and abnormal speech. Use the following hyperlink to view the
stroke scale.
A commonly used mnemonic regarding assessment of individuals
suspected of experiencing a stroke is âBEFAST.â  BEFAST stands for
Balance, Eyes, Face, Arm, and Speech Test.
â¢  B: Does the person have a sudden loss of balance?
â¢  E: Has the person lost vision in one or both eyes?
â¢  F: Does the personâs face look uneven?
â¢  A: Is one arm weak or numb?
â¢  S: Is the personâs speech slurred? Are they having trouble speaking or
seem confused?
â¢  T: Time to call for assistance immediately
Mini-Mental Status Exam
The Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) is commonly used to assess a
patientâs cognitive status when there is a concern of cognitive
impairment. The MMSE is sensitive and specific in detecting delirium anddementia in patients at a general hospital and in residents of long-term
care facilities.
Delirium is acute, reversible confusion that can be caused
by several medical conditions such as fever, infection, and lack of
oxygenation. Dementia is chronic, irreversible confusion and memory loss
that impacts functioning in everyday life.
Prior to administering the MMSE, ensure the patient is wearing their
glasses and/or hearing aids, if needed.
A patient can score up to 30 points
by accurately responding and following directions given by the examiner.
A score of 24-30 indicates no cognitive impairment, 18-23 indicates mild
cognitive impairment, and a score less than 18 indicates severe cognitive
impairment. See Figure 6.10
for an image of one of the questions on the
MMSE regarding interlocking pentagons.",1039

light touch according to regions of the skin known as dermatomes. A
dermatome is an area of the skin that is supplied by a single spinal nerve
that sends information to the brain for processing. See Figure 6.26
for an
illustration of color-coded dermatomes according to their associatedspinal nerves. See more information about spinal nerves in the âBasicNeurological Conceptsâ section.
To test the sensory fields, ask the patient to close their eyes, and then
gently touch the soft end of a cotton-tipped applicator on random
locations of the skin according to the dermatome region. Instruct the
patient to report âNowâ when feeling the placement of the applicator. If a
patient is unable to feel the sensation of a cotton applicator, an advanced
technique is to use ice or even the prick of a pin in comatose patients.
It is not necessary to test every part of the skinâs surface during a routine
neurological exam; testing a few distal areas with light touch is usually
sufficient. In-depth testing is performed when the patient is exhibiting
neurological symptoms such as motor deficits, numbness, tingling, and

CHAPTER 6 NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 6.8 Assessing Cerebellar Function,"Gait and Balance When assessing gait and balance, ask the patient to perform the following
actions, using an assistive device if needed:
â¢  Walk 10 feet, pivot, and walk back
â¢  Look straight ahead and walk heel to toe
â¢  Walk on tiptoes
â¢  Walk on heels
Steps should be equal with a regular pace while arms are swinging and
coordinated with walking. Balance should be maintained. A change in
gait, weakness, shuffling, jerky movements, loss of balance, or
incoordination of arm swing can indicate a neurological dysfunction. See
Figure 6.32
for an image of assessing gait and balance.
Pronator DriftAssessing for pronator drift helps to detect mild upper limb weakness. Ask
the patient to close their eyes and extend both arms at 90 degrees at
shoulder level with the palms facing upwards. The patient should try to
maintain this position for 20 to 30 seconds. Closing the eyes accentuates
the effect because the brain is deprived of visual information about the
position of the body and must rely on proprioception. Proprioception is
the awareness of body position and movement. The expected finding is
both arms will maintain this position equally. If the patient is unable to
maintain the position, the result is referred to as a positive pronator drift
test. Patients with weakness in one arm will not be able to keep the
affected arm raised, and ultimately the palm may begin to pronate (palm
facing down). In some patients, the arm may remain supinated but will
drop lower than the unaffected arm.","CHAPTER 6 NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 6.8 Assessing Cerebellar Function Gait and Balance When assessing gait and balance, ask the patient to perform the following

â¢  Walk 10 feet, pivot, and walk back
â¢  Look straight ahead and walk heel to toe
â¢  Walk on tiptoes
â¢  Walk on heels
Steps should be equal with a regular pace while arms are swinging and
coordinated with walking. Balance should be maintained. A change in
gait, weakness, shuffling, jerky movements, loss of balance, or
incoordination of arm swing can indicate a neurological dysfunction. See
Figure 6.32
for an image of assessing gait and balance.
Pronator DriftAssessing for pronator drift helps to detect mild upper limb weakness. Ask
the patient to close their eyes and extend both arms at 90 degrees at
shoulder level with the palms facing upwards. The patient should try to
maintain this position for 20 to 30 seconds. Closing the eyes accentuates
the effect because the brain is deprived of visual information about the
position of the body and must rely on proprioception. Proprioception is
the awareness of body position and movement. The expected finding is
both arms will maintain this position equally. If the patient is unable to
maintain the position, the result is referred to as a positive pronator drift
test. Patients with weakness in one arm will not be able to keep the
affected arm raised, and ultimately the palm may begin to pronate (palm
facing down). In some patients, the arm may remain supinated but will
drop lower than the unaffected arm.",372
CHAPTER 6 NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 6.8 Assessing Cerebellar Function,"Finger-to-Nose Test The finger-to-nose test assesses equilibrium and coordination. Place the
patient in a seated or standing position and ask them to close their eyes.
Instruct the patient to extend their arms outward from the sides of the
body, and then touch the tip of the nose with the right index finger and
return the arm to extended position. Repeat with the left side and
continue to repeat touching the nose with alternating movements by
both arms.
The expected finding is the patient will smoothly touch the nose with
alternating left and right index fingers and return their arms to an
extended position repeatedly. An abnormal result occurs when the patient
is unable to alternate fingers or demonstrates the inability to touch the
nose. For example, the patient may touch the cheek or other part of the
face, or movement may be clumsy with stops and restarts. See Figure 6.33
for an image of a finger-to-nose test.","CHAPTER 6 NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 6.8 Assessing Cerebellar Function Finger-to-Nose Test The finger-to-nose test assesses equilibrium and coordination. Place the

position with palms down on thighs. Ask the patient to turn their hands so
their palms face upwards and then quickly return them to a downward

CHAPTER 6 NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 6.9 Assessing Reflexes,"Brachioradialis Reflex The brachioradialis reflex is used to assess the cervical spine nerves C5 and
C6. Ask the patient to support their arm on their thigh or on your hand.
Identify the insertion of the brachioradialis tendon on the radius and
briskly tap it with the reflex hammer. The reflex consists of flexion and
supination of the forearm. See Figure 6.37
for an image of obtaining the
brachioradialis reflex.
Triceps ReflexThe triceps reflex assesses cervical spine nerves C6 and C7. Support the
patientâs arm underneath their bicep to maintain a position midway
between flexion and extension. Ask the patient to relax their arm and
allow it to fully be supported by your hand. Identify the triceps tendon
posteriorly just above its insertion on the olecranon. Tap briskly on the
tendon with the reflex hammer. Note extension of the forearm. See Figure
for an image of the triceps reflex exam.6.38
Patella (Knee Jerk) ReflexThe patellar reflex, commonly referred to as the knee jerk test, assesses
lumbar spine nerves L2, L3, and L4. Ask the patient to relax the leg and
allow it to swing freely at the knee. Tap the patella tendon briskly, looking
for an image of assessing afor extension of the lower leg. See Figure 6.39
patellar reflex.
Plantar ReflexThe plantar reflex assesses lumbar spine L5 and sacral spine S1. Ask the
patient to extend their lower leg, and then stabilize their foot in the air
with your hand. Stroke the lateral surface of the sole of the foot toward the
toes. Many patients are ticklish and withdraw their foot, so it is sufficient to
elicit the reflex by using your thumb to stroke lightly from the sole of the
foot toward the toes. If there is no response, use a blunt object such as a
key or pen. The expected reflex is flexion (i.e., bending) of the great toe. An
abnormal response is toe extension (i.e., straightening), also known as the
Babinski reflex, which is considered abnormal after 2 years of age. See
Figures 6.40 â 6.43
for images of assessing the plantar reflex.

Babinski-Plantar Reflex
Newborn ReflexesNewborn reflexes originate in the central nervous system and are
exhibited by infants at birth but disappear as part of child development.
Neurological disease or delayed development is indicated if these reflexes
are not present at birth, do not spontaneously resolve, or reappear in
adulthood. Common newborn reflexes include sucking, rooting, palmar
grasp, plantar grasp, Babinski, Moro, and tonic neck reflexes.
Sucking Reflex
The sucking reflex is common to all mammals and is present at birth. It is
linked with the rooting reflex and breastfeeding. It causes the child to
simulates the way a child naturally eats. See Figure 6.44
for an image of
the newborn sucking reflex.
Rooting Reflex
The rooting reflex assists in the act of breastfeeding. A newborn infant will
turn its head toward anything that strokes its cheek or mouth, searching
for the object by moving its head in steadily decreasing arcs until the
rooting reflex.
Palmar and Plantar Grasps
When an object is placed in an infantâs hand and the palm of the child is
stroked, the fingers will close reflexively, referred to as the palmar grasp
reflex. A similar reflexive action occurs if an object is placed on the plantar
surface of an infantâs foot, referred to as the plantar grasp reflex. See
Figure 6.46
for an image of the palmar grasp reflex.
Moro Reflex
The Moro reflex is present at birth and is often stimulated by a loud noise.
The Moro reflex occurs when the legs and head of the infant extend while
the arms jerk up and out with the palms up. See Figure 6.47
for an image
Tonic Neck Reflex
The asymmetrical tonic neck reflex, also known as the âfencing posture,â
occurs when the childâs head is turned to the side. The arm on the sameside as the head is turned will straighten and the opposite arm will bend.
See Figure 6.48
for an image of the tonic neck reflex.
Walking-Stepping Reflex
Although infants cannot support their own weight, when the soles of their
feet touch a surface, it appears as if they are attempting to walk by placing
one foot in front of the other foot.","CHAPTER 6 NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 6.9 Assessing Reflexes Brachioradialis Reflex The brachioradialis reflex is used to assess the cervical spine nerves C5 and

Collect data from the patient using effective communication and pay
particular attention to what the patient is reporting, including current
symptoms and any history of neurological illness. Ask follow-up questions
related to symptoms such as confusion, headache, vertigo, seizures, recent
injury or fall, weakness, numbness, tingling, difficulty swallowing (called
dysphagia) or speaking (called dysphasia), or lack of coordination of body
movements.
See Table 6.10a for sample interview questions to use during the

Life Span Considerations
NEWBORNAt birth, the neurologic system is not fully developed. The brain is still
developing, and the newbornâs anterior fontanelle doesnât close until
develop in the first year of life. The newbornâs sensory system responds to
stimuli by crying or moving body parts. Initial motor activity is primitive in
the form of newborn reflexes. Additional information about newbornreflexes is provided in the âAssessing Reflexesâ section. As the newborndevelops, so do the motor and sensory integration. Specific questions to
ask parents or caregivers of infants include the following:
â¢  Have you noticed your infant sleeping excessively or having difficulty
arousing?
â¢  Has your infant had difficulty feeding, sucking, or swallowing?
CHILDRENDepending on the childâs age and developmental level, they may answer
questions independently or the childâs parent/guardian may provide
information. Specific questions for children include the following:
â¢  Have you ever had a head injury or a concussion?
â¢  Do you experience headaches? If so, how often?
â¢  Have you had a seizure or convulsion?
â¢  Have you noticed if your child has any problems with walking or
balance?
â¢  Have you noticed if your child experiences episodes of not being
aware of their environment?
OLDER ADULTSThe aging adult experiences a general slowing in nerve conduction,
resulting in a slowed motor and sensory interaction. Fine coordination,
balance, and reflex activity may be impaired. There may also be a gradual
decrease in cerebral blood flow and oxygen use that can cause dizziness
and loss of balance. Examples of specific subjective questions for the older
adult include the following:
â¢  Have you ever had a head injury or recent fall?
â¢  Do you experience any shaking or tremors of your hands? If so, do they
occur more with rest or activity?
â¢  Have you had any weakness, numbness, or tingling in any of your
extremities?
â¢  Have you noticed a problem with balance or coordination?
â¢  Do you ever feel lightheaded or dizzy? If so, does it occur with activity
or change in position?","CHAPTER 6 NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 6.10 Neurological Assessment Subjective Assessment Subjective data collection guides the focus of the physical examination.

CHAPTER 6 NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT 6.10 Neurological Assessment,"Objective Assessment The physical examination of the neurological system includes assessment
of both the central and peripheral nervous systems. A routine neurological
exam usually starts by assessing the patientâs mental status followed by
evaluation of sensory function and motor function. Comprehensive
neurological exams may further evaluate cranial nerve function and deep
tendon reflexes. The nurse must be knowledgeable of what is normal or
expected for the patientâs age, development, and condition to analyze the
meaning of the data that is being collected.
Inspection
Nurses begin assessing a patientâs overall neurological status by observing
their general appearance, posture, ability to walk, and personal hygiene in
the first few minutes of nurse-patient interaction. For additional
information about obtaining an overall impression of a patientâs statuswhile performing an assessment, see the âGeneral Surveyâ chapter.
Level of orientation is assessed and other standardized tools to evaluate a
patientâs mental status may be used, such as the Glasgow Coma Scale
(GCS), NIH Stroke Scale, or Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). Read more
information about these tools under the âAssessing Mental Statusâ section
earlier in this chapter.
The nurse also assesses a patientâs cerebellar function by observing their
gait and balance. See the âAssessing Cerebellar Functionâ section earlier in
chapter for more information.
Auscultation
Auscultation refers to the action of listening to sounds from the heart,
lungs, or other organs with a stethoscope as a part of physical
examination. Auscultation is not typically performed by registered nurses
during a routine neurological assessment. However, advanced practice
nurses and other health care providers may auscultate the carotid arteries
for the presence of a swishing sound called a bruit. Bruits suggest
interference with cerebral blood flow that can cause neurological deficits.
Palpation
Palpation during a physical examination typically refers to the use of touch
to evaluate organs for size, location, or tenderness, but palpation during
the neurologic physical exam involves using touch to assess sensoryfunction and motor function. Refer to sections on âAssessing SensoryFunction,â âAssessing Motor Function,â âAssessing Cranial Nerves,â and
âAssessing Reflexesâ earlier in this chapter for additional information on
how to perform these tests.

physiology of the head and neck and common medical conditions.",192
CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT 7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts,"Anatomy Skull
The anterior skull consists of facial bones that provide the bony support for
the eyes and structures of the face. This anterior view of the skull is
dominated by the openings of the orbits, the nasal cavity, and the upper
and lower jaws. See Figure 7.1
for an illustration of the skull. The orbit is the
bony socket that houses the eyeball and the muscles that move the
eyeball. Inside the nasal area of the skull, the nasal cavity is divided into
halves by the nasal septum that consists of both bone and cartilage
components. The mandible forms the lower jaw and is the only movable
bone in the skull. The maxilla forms the upper jaw and supports the upper
teeth.
The brain case surrounds and protects the brain that occupies the cranial
The brain case consists of eight bones, including the paired parietal and
temporal bones plus the unpaired frontal, occipital, sphenoid, and
ethmoid bones.
A suture is an interlocking joint between adjacent bones of the skull and is
filled with dense, fibrous connective tissue that unites the bones. In a
newborn infant, the pressure from vaginal delivery compresses the head
and causes the bony plates to overlap at the sutures, creating a small
ridge. Over the next few days, the head expands, the overlapping
the normal position for the remainder of the life span and the sutures
become immobile.
See Figure 7.3
for an illustration of two of the sutures, the coronal and
squamous sutures, on the lateral view of the head. The coronal suture is
seen on the top of the skull. It runs from side to side across the skull and
joins the frontal bone to the right and left parietal bones. The squamous
suture is located on the lateral side of the skull. It unites the squamous
portion of the temporal bone with the parietal bone. At the intersection of
the coronal and squamous sutures is the pterion, a small, capital H-shaped
suture line region that unites the frontal bone, parietal bone, temporal
bone, and greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The pterion is an important
clinical landmark because located immediately under it, inside the skull, is
a major branch of an artery that supplies the brain. A strong blow to this
region can fracture the bones around the pterion. If the underlying artery
is damaged, bleeding can cause the formation of a collection of blood,
called a hematoma, between the brain and interior of the skull, which can
be life-threatening.
Paranasal Sinuses
The paranasal sinuses are hollow, air-filled spaces located within the skull.
See Figure 7.4
for an illustration of the sinuses. The sinuses connect with
the nasal cavity and are lined with nasal mucosa. They reduce bone mass,
has a cold or sinus congestion, the mucosa swells and produces excess
mucus that often obstructs the narrow passageways between the sinuses
and the nasal cavity. The resulting pressure produces pain and
discomfort.
Each of the paranasal sinuses is named for the skull bone that it occupies.
The frontal sinus is located just above the eyebrows within the frontal
bone. The largest sinus, the maxillary sinus, is paired and located within
the right and left maxillary bones just below the orbits. The maxillary
sinuses are most commonly involved during sinus infections. The
sphenoid sinus is a single, midline sinus located within the body of the
sphenoid bone. The lateral aspects of the ethmoid bone contain multiple
small spaces separated by very thin, bony walls. Each of these spaces is
called an ethmoid air cell.
Anatomy of Nose, Pharynx, and Mouth
See Figure 7.5
to review the anatomy of the head and neck. The major
entrance and exit for the respiratory system is through the nose. The
bridge of the nose consists of bone, but the protruding portion of the nose
is composed of cartilage. The nares are the nostril openings that open into
the nasal cavity and are separated into left and right sections by the nasal
septum. The floor of the nasal cavity is composed of the palate. The hard
palate is located at the anterior region of the nasal cavity and is composed
of bone. The soft palate is located at the posterior portion of the nasal
cavity and consists of muscle tissue. The uvula is a small, teardrop-shaped
structure located at the apex of the soft palate. Both the uvula and soft
palate move like a pendulum during swallowing, swinging upward to
close off the nasopharynx and prevent ingested materials from entering
the nasal cavity.
As air is inhaled through the nose, the paranasal sinuses warm and
humidify the incoming air as it moves into the pharynx. The pharynx is a
tube-lined mucous membrane that begins at the nasal cavity and is
divided into three major regions: the nasopharynx, the oropharynx, and
the laryngopharynx.
The nasopharynx serves only as an airway. At the top of the nasopharynx
is the pharyngeal tonsil, commonly referred to as the adenoids. Adenoids
are lymphoid tissue that trap and destroy invading pathogens that enter
during inhalation. They are large in children but tend to regress with age
and may even disappear.
The oropharynx is a passageway for both air and food. The oropharynx is
bordered superiorly by the nasopharynx and anteriorly by the oral cavity.
The oropharynx contains two sets of tonsils, the palatine and lingual
tonsils. The palatine tonsil is located laterally in the oropharynx, and the
lingual tonsil is located at the base of the tongue. Similar to the
pharyngeal tonsil, the palatine and lingual tonsils are composed of
lymphoid tissue and trap and destroy pathogens entering the body
through the oral or nasal cavities. See Figure 7.6
for an image of the oral
cavity and oropharynx with enlarged palatine tonsils.
The laryngopharynx is inferior to the oropharynx and posterior to the
larynx. It continues the route for ingested material and air until its inferior
end where the digestive and respiratory systems diverge. Anteriorly, the
laryngopharynx opens into the larynx and posteriorly, it enters the
esophagus that leads to the stomach. The larynx connects the pharynx to
the trachea and helps regulate the volume of air that enters and leaves
the lungs. It also contains the vocal cords that vibrate as air passes over
them to produce the sound of a personâs voice. The trachea extends from
the larynx to the lungs. The epiglottis is a flexible piece of cartilage that
covers the opening of the trachea during swallowing to prevent ingested
material from entering the trachea.
Muscles and Nerves of the Head and Neck
FACIAL MUSCLESSeveral nerves innervate the facial muscles to create facial expressions.
See Figure 7.7
for an illustration of nerves innervating facial muscles.
These nerves and muscles are tested during a cranial nerve exam. See
more information about performing a cranial nerve exam in theâNeurological Assessmentâ chapter.
When a patient is experiencing a cerebrovascular accident (i.e., stroke), it is
facial expression that occurs due to damage of the nerve innervating a
specific part of the face. See Figure 7.8
for an image of facial drooping
occurring on the patientâs right side of their face.
NECK MUSCLESThe muscles of the anterior neck assist in swallowing and speech by
controlling the positions of the larynx and the hyoid bone, a horseshoe-
shaped bone that functions as a solid foundation on which the tongue
can move. The head, attached to the top of the vertebral column, is
balanced, moved, and rotated by the neck muscles. When these muscles
act unilaterally, the head rotates. When they contract bilaterally, the head
flexes or extends. The major muscle that laterally flexes and rotates the
head is the sternocleidomastoid. The trapezius muscle elevates the
shoulders (shrugging), pulls the shoulder blades together, and tilts the
head backwards. See Figure 7.9
for an illustration of the
sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles.
Both of these muscles are
tested during a cranial nerve assessment. See more information about
cranial nerve assessment in the âNeurological Assessmentâ chapter.
JAW MUSCLESThe masseter muscle is the main muscle used for chewing because it
elevates the mandible (lower jaw) to close the mouth. It is assisted by the
temporalis muscle that retracts the mandible. The temporalis muscle can
be felt moving by placing fingers on the patientâs temple as they chew.
See Figure 7.10muscles.
for an illustration of the masseter and temporalis
TONGUE MUSCLESMuscles of the tongue are necessary for chewing, swallowing, and speech.
Because it is so moveable, the tongue facilitates complex speech patterns
and sounds.
Airway and Unconsciousness
When a patient becomes unconscious and is lying supine, the tongue
to open the airway when performing CPR by using a chin-thrust
maneuver. See Figure 7.11
for an image of the tongue blocking the
airway.  In a similar manner, when a patient is administered general
anesthesia during surgery, the tongue relaxes and can block the airway.
For this reason, endotracheal intubation is performed during surgery with
general anesthesia by placing a tube into the trachea to maintain an open
airway to the lungs. After surgery, patients often report a sore or scratchy
throat for a few days due to the endotracheal intubation.
SWALLOWINGSwallowing is a complex process that uses 50 pairs of muscles and many
nerves to receive food in the mouth, prepare it, and move it from the
mouth to the stomach. Swallowing occurs in three stages. During the first
stage, called the oral phase, the tongue collects the food or liquid and
makes it ready for swallowing. The tongue and jaw move solid food around
in the mouth so it can be chewed and made the right size and texture to
swallow by mixing food with saliva. The second stage begins when the
tongue pushes the food or liquid to the back of the mouth. This triggers a
swallowing response that passes the food through the pharynx. During
this phase, called the pharyngeal phase, the epiglottis closes off the larynx
and breathing stops to prevent food or liquid from entering the airway
and lungs. The third stage begins when food or liquid enters the
esophagus and it is carried to the stomach. The passage through the
esophagus, called the esophageal phase, usually occurs in about three
seconds.

Swallowing Process:
Swallowing
Dysphagia is the medical term for swallowing difficulties that occur when
there is a problem with the nerves or structures involved in the swallowing
process.
Nurses are often the first to notice signs of dysphagia in their
patients that can occur due to a multitude of medical conditions such as astroke, head injury, or dementia. For more information about thesymptoms, screening, and treatment for dysphagia, go to the âCommon
Conditions of the Head and Neckâ section.
Lymphatic System
The lymphatic system is the system of vessels, cells, and organs that
carries excess interstitial fluid to the bloodstream and filters pathogens
from the blood through lymph nodes found near the neck, armpits, chest,
abdomen, and groin. See Figure 7.12
27 and Figure 7.13
for an illustration of
the lymph nodes found in the head and neck regions.  When a person is
fighting off an infection, the lymph nodes in that region become enlarged,
indicating an active immune response to infection.","CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT 7.2 Head and Neck Basic Concepts Anatomy Skull

PharyngitisPharyngitis is the medical term used for infection and/or inflammation in
the back of the throat (pharynx). Common causes of pharyngitis are the
cold viruses, influenza, strep throat caused by group A streptococcus, and
mononucleosis. Strep throat typically causes white patches on the tonsils
with a fever and enlarged lymph nodes. It must be treated with antibiotics
to prevent potential complications in the heart and kidneys. See Figure

If not diagnosed as strep throat, most cases of pharyngitis are caused by
viruses, and the treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms. Nurses

CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT 7.3 Common Conditions of the Head and Neck,"Epistaxis Epistaxis, the medical term for a nose bleed, is a common problem
affecting up to 60 million Americans each year. Although most cases of
epistaxis are minor and manageable with conservative measures, severe
cases can become life-threatening if the bleeding cannot be stopped.
See Figure 7.17
for an image of a severe case of epistaxis.
The most common cause of epistaxis is dry nasal membranes in winter
months due to low temperatures and low humidity. Other common
causes are picking inside the nose with fingers, trauma, anatomical
deformity, high blood pressure, and clotting disorders. Medications
associated with epistaxis are aspirin, clopidogrel, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, and anticoagulants.
To treat a nose bleed, have the victim lean forward at the waist and pinch
the lateral sides of the nose with the thumb and index finger for up to 15
minutes while breathing through the mouth.
Continued bleeding
despite this intervention requires urgent medical intervention such as
nasal packing.","CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT 7.3 Common Conditions of the Head and Neck Epistaxis Epistaxis, the medical term for a nose bleed, is a common problem

CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT 7.3 Common Conditions of the Head and Neck,"Cleft Lip and Palate During embryonic development, the right and left maxilla bones come
together at the midline to form the upper jaw. At the same time, the
muscle and skin overlying these bones join together to form the upper lip.
Inside the mouth, the palatine processes of the maxilla bones, along with
the horizontal plates of the right and left palatine bones, join together to
form the hard palate. If an error occurs in these developmental processes,
a birth defect of cleft lip or cleft palate may result.
Cleft lip is a common developmental defect that affects approximately
1:1,000 births, most of which are male. This defect involves a partial or
complete failure of the right and left portions of the upper lip to fusetogether, leaving a cleft (gap). See Figure 7.18
for an image of an infant
with a cleft lip.
cavity. See Figure 7.19
for an illustration of a cleft palate. Cleft palate
affects approximately 1:2,500 births and is more common in females. It
results from a failure of the two halves of the hard palate to completely
come together and fuse at the midline, thus leaving a gap between the
nasal and oral cavities. In severe cases, the bony gap continues into the
anterior upper jaw where the alveolar processes of the maxilla bones also
do not properly join together above the front teeth. If this occurs, a cleft lip
will also be seen. Because of the communication between the oral and
nasal cavities, a cleft palate makes it very difficult for an infant to generate
the suckling needed for nursing, thus creating risk for malnutrition.
Surgical repair is required to correct a cleft palate.","CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT 7.3 Common Conditions of the Head and Neck Cleft Lip and Palate During embryonic development, the right and left maxilla bones come

Candidiasis in the mouth and throat can have many symptoms, including
the following:
â¢  White patches on the inner cheeks, tongue, roof of the mouth, and
throat
â¢  Redness or soreness
â¢  Cotton-like feeling in the mouth

CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT 7.3 Common Conditions of the Head and Neck,"âMeth Mouthâ The use of methamphetamine (i.e., meth), a strong stimulant drug, has
become an alarming public health issue in the United States. A common
sign of meth abuse is extreme tooth and gum decay often referred to as
âMeth Mouth.â  See Figure 7.22
for an image of Meth Mouth.
Signs of Meth Mouth include the following:
â¢  Dry Mouth. Methamphetamines dry out the salivary glands, and the
acid content in the mouth will start to destroy the enamel on the
teeth. Eventually this will lead to cavities.
â¢  Cracked Teeth. Methamphetamine can make the user feel anxious,
hyper, or nervous, so they clench or grind their teeth. You may see
severe wear patterns on their teeth.
â¢  Tooth Decay. Meth users crave beverages high in sugar while they are
âhigh.â The bacteria that feed on the sugars in the mouth will secrete
acid, which can lead to more tooth destruction. With meth users,
tooth decay will start at the gum line and eventually spread
throughout the tooth. The front teeth are usually destroyed first.
â¢  Gum Disease. Methamphetamine users do not seek out regular dental
treatment. Lack of oral health care can contribute to periodontal
disease. Methamphetamines also cause the blood vessels that supply
the oral tissues to shrink in size, reducing blood flow, causing the
tissues to break down.
â¢  Lesions. Users who smoke meth present with lesions and/or burns on
their lips or gingival inside the cheeks or on the hard palate. Users who
snort may present burns in the back of their throats.
Nurses who notice possible signs of Meth Mouth should report their
concerns to the health care provider, not only for a referral for dental care,
but also for treatment of suspected substance abuse.","CHAPTER 7 HEAD AND NECK ASSESSMENT 7.3 Common Conditions of the Head and Neck âMeth Mouthâ The use of methamphetamine (i.e., meth), a strong stimulant drug, has

CHAPTER 8 EYE AND EAR ASSESSMENT 8.2 Eye and Ear Basic Concepts,"Anatomy of the Eye Our sense of vision occurs due to transduction of light stimuli received
through the eyes. The eyes are located within either orbit in the skull. See
Figure 8.1
for an illustration of the eye. The eyelids, with lashes at their
leading edges, help to protect the eye from abrasions by blocking
particles that may land on the surface of the eye. The inner surface of each
lid is a thin membrane known as the conjunctiva. The conjunctiva extends
over the white areas of the eye called the sclera, connecting the eyelids to
the eyeball. The iris is the colored part of the eye. The iris is a smooth
muscle that opens and closes the pupil, the hole at the center of the eye
that allows light to enter. The iris constricts the pupil in response to bright
light and dilates the pupil in response to dim light. The cornea is the
transparent front part of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and anterior
chamber. The cornea, with the anterior chamber and lens, refracts light
and contributes to vision. The cornea can be reshaped by surgical
procedures such as LASIK. The innermost layer of the eye is the retina that

CHAPTER 8 EYE AND EAR ASSESSMENT 8.2 Eye and Ear Basic Concepts,"Common Disorders of the Eye Eye disorders that nurses commonly see in practice include myopia,
macular degeneration, and glaucoma.
Myopia
Myopia is impaired vision, also known as nearsightedness that makes far-
away objects look blurry. It happens when the eyeball grows too long from
front to back or when there are problems with the shape of the cornea or
the lens. These problems make light focus in front of the retina, instead of
on it, causing blurriness. See Figure 8.3
for a simulated image of a
personâs vision with myopia. Nearsightedness usually becomes apparent
between ages 6 and 14. It is corrected with glasses, contacts, or LASIK
surgery.
Presbyopia
Presbyopia is impaired near vision. It commonly occurs in middle-aged
and older adults,  making it difficult to clearly see objects up close. As
people age, the lens in the eye gets harder and less flexible and stops
focusing light correctly on the retina.
Presbyopia can be corrected with
glasses and/or contacts. See Figure 8.4
for a simulated image of a
personâs vision with presbyopia.
Color Blindness
Color blindness makes it difficult to differentiate between certain colors.
Color blindness can occur due to damage to the eye or to the brain.
Thereâs no cure for color blindness, but special glasses and contact lenses
can help people differentiate between colors. Most people who have colorblindness are able to use visual strategies related to color selection and
donât have problems participating in everyday activities.
Dry Eye
Dry eye is a very common eye condition that occurs when the eyes donât
make enough tears to stay wet or the tears donât work correctly.
Symptoms of dry eye include a scratchy feeling, stinging, and burning.
Treatment includes over-the-counter and prescription eye drops, as well as
lifestyle changes to decrease the dryness of the eyes.
Conjunctivitis
Conjunctivitis is a viral or bacterial infection that causes swelling and
redness in the conjunctiva and sclera. See Figure 8.5
for an image of
conjunctivitis. The eye may feel itchy and painful with crusty yellow
drainage present. Conjunctivitis is very contagious, so the nurse should
educate the patient and family caregivers to wash hands frequently.
Additionally, the patient should not share items like pillowcases, towels, or
makeup. Bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotic eye drops.
Stye
A stye is a bacterial infection of an oil gland in the eyelid, causing a red,
tender bump at the edge of the eyelid. See Figure 8.6
for an image of a
stye. Treatment includes applying warm compresses to the eyelid and
prescription eyedrops.
Cataracts
A cataract is a cloudy area on the lens of the eye. Cataracts are very
common in older adults. Over half of all Americans age 80 or older either
have cataracts or have had surgery to remove cataracts. See Figure 8.7
for
an image of a cataract. Cataracts develop slowly and symptoms include
faded colors, blurred or double vision, halos around light, and trouble
17 for a simulated image of a personâs vision
with cataracts. Decreased vision due to cataracts may result in trouble
reading and driving and increases the risk of falling. Patients often
undergo surgery for cataracts. During cataract surgery, the doctor
removes the clouded lens and replaces it with a new, artificial lens.
Macular Degeneration
Age-related macular degeneration is a common condition that causes
blurred central vision. It is the leading cause of vision loss for people 50
for a simulated image of a personâs vision withand older. See Figure 8.9macular degeneration. There are two types of macular degeneration: dry
(nonexudative) and wet (exudative). During dry macular degeneration,
cellular debris called drusen accumulates and scars the retina. In the wet
(exudative) form, which is more severe, blood vessels grow behind the
retina that leak exudate fluid, causing hemorrhaging and scarring. There is
no treatment for dry macular degeneration, but laser therapy can be used
to help treat wet (exudative) macular degeneration.
Glaucoma
Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that causes vision loss by damaging
the optic nerve due to increased intraocular pressure. Treatment includes
progression of the disease. If not treated appropriately, glaucoma can
cause blindness. Symptoms of glaucoma include gradual loss of
peripheral vision. See Figure 8.10
21 for a simulated image of a personâs
vision with glaucoma. Because the loss of vision occurs so slowly, many
people donât realize they have symptoms until the disease is well-
progressed or it is discovered during an eye exam.","CHAPTER 8 EYE AND EAR ASSESSMENT 8.2 Eye and Ear Basic Concepts Common Disorders of the Eye Eye disorders that nurses commonly see in practice include myopia,

CHAPTER 8 EYE AND EAR ASSESSMENT 8.2 Eye and Ear Basic Concepts,"Screening Tools for Eye Exams Common screening tools used during an eye exam are the Snellen chart, a
near vision chart, and Ishihara plates. Nurses working in outpatient
vision problems. If a vision problem is identified, the patient is referred to
an optometrist for further testing. When performing a vision assessment,
be sure to provide adequate lighting.
Snellen Chart
Distant vision is tested by using the Snellen chart. See Figure 8.11
for an
image of the Snellen chart. Place the patient 20 feet away from the
Snellen chart. Ask them to cover one eye and read the letters from the
lowest line they can see clearly. Record the corresponding fraction in the
furthermost right-hand column. Repeat with the other eye. If the patient
is wearing glasses or contact lens during this assessment, document the
results as âcorrected visionâ when wearing these assistive devices.
A person with no visual impairment is documented as having  20/20
vision. A person with impaired vision has a different lower denominator of
this fraction. For example, a vision measurement of 20/30 indicates the
patient can see letters clearly at 20 feet that a person with normal vision
can see clearly at 30 feet.
Alternative charts are also available for children
or adults who canât read letters in English. See Figure 8.12
for an
alternative eye chart.
Near Vision
Near vision is assessed by having a patient read from a prepared card that
is held 14 inches away from the eyes. If a card is not available, the patient
can be asked to read from a newspaper as an alternative quick screening
tool. See Figure 8.13
for an image of a prepared card used to assess near

CHAPTER 8 EYE AND EAR ASSESSMENT 8.2 Eye and Ear Basic Concepts,"Anatomy of the Ear Hearing is the transduction of sound waves into a neural signal by the
structures of the ear. See Figure 8.15
for an image of the anatomy of the
ear. The large, fleshy structure on the lateral aspect of the head is known
as the auricle. The C-shaped curves of the auricle direct sound waves
toward the ear canal. At the end of the ear canal is the tympanic
membrane, commonly referred to as the eardrum, that vibrates after it is
struck by sound waves. The auricle, ear canal, and tympanic membrane
are referred to as the external ear. The middle ear consists of a space with
three small bones called the malleus, incus, and stapes, the Latin names
that roughly translate to âhammer,â âanvil,â and âstirrup.â The malleus is
incus, in turn, articulates with the stapes. The stapes is attached to the
inner ear, where the sound waves are transduced into a neural signal. The
middle ear is also connected to the pharynx through the Eustachian tube
that helps equilibrate air pressure across the tympanic membrane. The
Eustachian tube is normally closed but will pop open when the muscles of
the pharynx contract during swallowing or yawning. The inner ear is often
described as a bony labyrinth because it is composed of a series of
semicircular canals. The semicircular canals have two separate regions, the
cochlea and the vestibule, that are responsible for hearing and balance.
The neural signals from these two regions are relayed to the brain stem
through separate fiber bundles. However, they travel together from the
inner ear to the brain stem as the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve
VIII).
Hearing
Sound waves cause the tympanic membrane to vibrate. This vibration is
amplified as it moves across the malleus, incus, and stapes and into the
cochlea. Within the inner ear, the cochlear duct contains sound-
transducing neurons. As the frequency of a sound changes, different hair
cells within the cochlear duct are sensitive to a particular frequency. In this
manner, the cochlea separates auditory stimuli by frequency and sends
impulses to the brain stem via the cochlear nerve. The cochlea encodes
auditory stimuli for frequencies between 20 and 20,000 Hz, the range of
sound that human ears can detect.
Balance
Along with hearing, the inner ear is also responsible for the sense of
balance. Semicircular canals in the vestibule have three ring-like
extensions. One extension is oriented in the horizontal plane, and the
other two are oriented in the vertical plane.  Hair cells within the vestibule
sense head position, head movement, and body motion. By comparing
the relative movements of both the horizontal and vertical planes, the
vestibular system can detect the direction of most head movements
within three-dimensional space. However, medical conditions affecting
the semicircular canals cause incorrect signals to be sent to the brain,
resulting in a spinning type of dizziness called vertigo.
Video Review of Anatomy of the Ear
Common Ear Disorders
HEARING LOSSHearing loss is classified as conductive hearing loss or sensorineural
hearing loss. Conductive hearing loss occurs when something in the
external or middle ear is obstructing the transmission of sound. For
example, cerumen impaction or a perforated tympanic membrane can
cause conductive hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss is caused by
pathology of the inner ear, cranial nerve VIII, or auditory areas of the
cerebral cortex. Presbycusis is sensorineural hearing loss that occurs with
aging due to gradual nerve degeneration. Ototoxic medications can also
cause sensorineural hearing loss by affecting the hair cells in the cochlea.
ACUTE OTITIS MEDIAAcute otitis media is the medical diagnosis for an middle ear infection.
Ear infections are a common illness in the pediatric population. Children
between the ages of 6 months and 2 years are more susceptible to ear
infections because of the size and shape of their Eustachian tubes.  Acute
otitis media typically occurs after an upper respiratory infection when the
Eustachian tube becomes inflamed and the middle ear fills with fluid,
causing ear pain and irritability. This fluid can become infected, causing
purulent fluid and low-grade fever. Acute otitis media is diagnosed by ahealth care provider using an otoscope to examine the tympanic
membrane for bulging and purulent fluid. If not treated, acute otitis media
can potentially cause perforation of the tympanic membrane. Treating
early acute otitis media with antibiotics is controversial in the United
States due to the effort to prevent antibiotic resistance. However, the
treatment goals are to control pain and treat infection with antibiotics if a
bacterial infection is present.
Some children develop recurrent ear infections that can cause hearing
loss affecting their language development. For children experiencing
recurring cases, a surgery called myringotomy surgery is performed by an
otolaryngologist. During myringotomy surgery, a tympanostomy tube is
placed in the tympanic membrane to drain fluid from the middle ear and
prevent infection from developing. If a child has a tympanostomy tube in
place, it is expected to see clear fluid in their ear canal as it drains out of
the tube. See Figure 8.16
for an image of a tympanostomy tube in the
ear.
OTITIS EXTERNAOtitis externa is the medical diagnosis for external ear inflammation and/
or infection. See Figure 8.17
for an image of otitis externa. It is commonly
known as âswimmerâs earâ because it commonly occurs in swimmers,
especially in summer months. Otitis externa can occur in all age groups
and causes an erythematous and edematous ear canal with associated
yellow, white, or grey debris. Patients often report itching in the ear canal
with pain that is worsened by pulling upwards and outwards on the
auricle. Otitis externa is treated with antibiotic drops placed in the ear
canals.
CERUMEN IMPACTIONCerumen impaction refers to a buildup of earwax causing occlusion of the
ear canal. This occlusion often causes symptoms such as hearing loss, ear
fullness, and itching. See Figure 8.18
for an image of cerumen impaction.
Cerumen can be removed via irrigation of the ear canal, ear drops to
dissolve the wax, or manual removal.
In outpatient settings, nurses often
assist with ear irrigation to remove cerumen impaction according to
agency policy.  See Figure 8.19
for an image of an ear irrigation
procedure.
TINNITUSTinnitus is a ringing, buzzing, roaring, hissing, or whistling sound in the
ears. The noise may be intermittent or continuous. Tinnitus can be caused
by cerumen impaction, noise trauma, or ototoxic medications, such as
diuretics or high doses of aspirin. Military personnel have a high incidence
of tinnitus due to noise trauma from loud explosions and gunfire. There
are no medications to treat tinnitus, but patients can be referred to an
otolaryngologist for treatment such as cognitive therapy or noise
VERTIGOVertigo is a type of dizziness that is often described by patients as, âthe
room feels as if it is spinning.â Benign positional vertigo (BPV) is a
common condition caused by crystals becoming lodged in the
semicircular canals in the vestibule of the inner ear that send false
movement signals to the brain. BPV can be treated by trained
professionals using a specific set of maneuvers that guide the crystals
back to the chamber where they are supposed to be in the inner ear.","CHAPTER 8 EYE AND EAR ASSESSMENT 8.2 Eye and Ear Basic Concepts Anatomy of the Ear Hearing is the transduction of sound waves into a neural signal by the

or infection. See Figure 8.17
for an image of otitis externa. It is commonly
known as âswimmerâs earâ because it commonly occurs in swimmers,
especially in summer months. Otitis externa can occur in all age groups
and causes an erythematous and edematous ear canal with associated
yellow, white, or grey debris. Patients often report itching in the ear canal
with pain that is worsened by pulling upwards and outwards on the
auricle. Otitis externa is treated with antibiotic drops placed in the ear
canals.
CERUMEN IMPACTIONCerumen impaction refers to a buildup of earwax causing occlusion of the
ear canal. This occlusion often causes symptoms such as hearing loss, ear
fullness, and itching. See Figure 8.18
for an image of cerumen impaction.
Cerumen can be removed via irrigation of the ear canal, ear drops to
dissolve the wax, or manual removal.
In outpatient settings, nurses often
assist with ear irrigation to remove cerumen impaction according to
agency policy.  See Figure 8.19
for an image of an ear irrigation
procedure.
TINNITUSTinnitus is a ringing, buzzing, roaring, hissing, or whistling sound in the
ears. The noise may be intermittent or continuous. Tinnitus can be caused
by cerumen impaction, noise trauma, or ototoxic medications, such as
diuretics or high doses of aspirin. Military personnel have a high incidence
of tinnitus due to noise trauma from loud explosions and gunfire. There
are no medications to treat tinnitus, but patients can be referred to an
otolaryngologist for treatment such as cognitive therapy or noise
VERTIGOVertigo is a type of dizziness that is often described by patients as, âthe
room feels as if it is spinning.â Benign positional vertigo (BPV) is a
common condition caused by crystals becoming lodged in the
semicircular canals in the vestibule of the inner ear that send false
movement signals to the brain. BPV can be treated by trained
professionals using a specific set of maneuvers that guide the crystals
back to the chamber where they are supposed to be in the inner ear.",1849

CHAPTER 8 EYE AND EAR ASSESSMENT 8.3 Eye and Ear Assessment,"Objective Assessment A routine assessment of the eyes and ears by registered nurses in
inpatient and outpatient settings typically includes external inspection of
eyes and ears for signs of a medical condition, as well as screening for
vision and hearing problems. A vision screening test, whispered voice
hearing test, and assessment of pupillary response are often included in1 Additional assessments may be
the physical exam based on the setting.performed if the patientâs status warrants assessment of the cranial
nerves.
Inspection
EYESBegin the assessment by inspecting the eyes. The sclera should be white
and the conjunctiva should be pink. There should not be any drainage
from the eyes. The patient should demonstrate behavioral cues indicating
effective vision during the assessment.
EARSInspect the ears. There should not be any drainage from the ears or
evidence of cerumen impaction. The patient should demonstrate
behavioral cues indicating effective hearing.
Vision Tests
See more information about procedures for assessing vision in the âEyeand Ear Basic Conceptsâ section earlier in this chapter. Assess far vision
using the Snellen eye chart. In outpatient settings, near vision may be
assessed using a prepared card or a newspaper. Color vision may be
assessed using a book containing Ishihara plates.
Hearing Test
Nurses perform a basic hearing assessment during conversation with the
patient. For example, the following patient cues during normal
conversation can indicate hearing loss:
â¢  Lip-reads or watches your face and lips closely rather than your eyes
â¢  Leans forward or appears to strain to hear what you are saying
â¢  Moves head in a position to catch sounds with the better ear
â¢  Misunderstands your questions or frequently asks you to repeat
â¢  Uses an inappropriately loud voice
â¢  Demonstrates garbled speech or distorted vowel sounds
WHISPER TESTThe whispered voice test is an effective screening test used to detect
hearing impairment if performed accurately. Complete the following steps
to accurately perform this test:
â¢  Stand at armâs length behind the seated patient to prevent lip reading.
â¢  Test each ear individually. The patient should be instructed to occlude
the nontested ear with their finger.
â¢  Exhale before whispering and use as quiet a voice as possible.
â¢  Whisper a combination of numbers and letters (for example, 4-K-2),
â¢  If the patient responds correctly, their hearing is considered normal; if
the patient responds incorrectly, the test is repeated using a different
number/letter combination.
â¢  The patient is considered to have passed the screening test if they
repeat at least three out of a possible six numbers or letters correctly.
â¢  The other ear is assessed similarly with a different combination of
numbers and letters.
Pupillary Response, Extraocular Movement, and CranialNerves
When a patient is suspected of experiencing a neurological disease or
injury, their pupils are assessed to ensure they are bilaterally equal, round,
and responsive to light and accommodation (PERRLA). Extraocular
movement and other cranial nerves may also be assessed that affect
vision, hearing, and balance. For more information about how to assess
PERRLA, extraocular eye movement, and other cranial nerves, go to theâAssessing Cranial Nervesâ section in the âNeurological Assessmentâchapter.

CHAPTER 9 CARDIOVASCULAR ASSESSMENT 9.3 Cardiovascular Assessment,"Subjective Assessment The subjective assessment of the cardiovascular and peripheral vascular
system is vital for uncovering signs of potential dysfunction. To complete
the subjective cardiovascular assessment, the nurse begins with a focused

CHAPTER 9 CARDIOVASCULAR ASSESSMENT 9.3 Cardiovascular Assessment,"Objective Assessment The physical examination of the cardiovascular system involves the
interpretation of vital signs, inspection, palpation, and auscultation of
heart sounds as the nurse evaluates for sufficient perfusion and cardiac
output.
Equipment needed for a cardiovascular assessment includes a
stethoscope, penlight, centimeter ruler or tape measure, and
sphygmomanometer.
Evaluate Vital Signs and Level of Consciousness
Interpret the blood pressure and pulse readings to verify the patient is
stable before proceeding with the physical exam. Assess the level of
consciousness; the patient should be alert and cooperative.
Inspection
â¢  Skin color to assess perfusion. Inspect the face, lips, and fingertips for
cyanosis or pallor. Cyanosis is a bluish discoloration of the skin, lips,
and nail beds and indicates decreased perfusion and oxygenation.
Pallor is the loss of color, or paleness of the skin or mucous
membranes, as a result of reduced blood flow, oxygenation, or
decreased number of red blood cells. Patients with light skin tones
should be pink in color. For those with darker skin tones, assess for
pallor on the palms, conjunctiva, or inner aspect of the lower lip.
â¢  Jugular Vein Distension (JVD). Inspect the neck for JVD that occurs
when the increased pressure of the superior vena cava causes the
jugular vein to bulge, making it most visible on the right side of a
personâs neck. JVD should not be present in the upright position or
when the head of bed is at 30-45 degrees.
â¢  Precordium for abnormalities. Inspect the chest area over the heart
(also called precordium) for deformities, scars, or any abnormal
pulsations the underlying cardiac chambers and great vessels may
produce.
â¢  Extremities:
â¦  Upper Extremities: Inspect the fingers, arms, and hands bilaterallynoting Color, Warmth, Movement, Sensation (CWMS). Alterations
or bilateral inconsistency in CWMS may indicate underlying
bed until it blanches and record the time taken for the color to
return to the nail bed. Normal capillary refill is less than 3
seconds.
â¦  Lower Extremities: Inspect the toes, feet, and legs bilaterally,noting CWMS, capillary refill, and the presence of peripheral
edema, superficial distended veins, and hair distribution.
Document the location and size of any skin ulcers.
âª  Edema: Note any presence of edema. Peripheral edema isswelling that can be caused by infection, thrombosis, or
venous insufficiency due to an accumulation of fluid in the
tissues. (See Figure 9.6
12 for an image of pedal edema.)
âª  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is
a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body. DVT
requires emergency notification of the health care provider
and immediate follow-up because of the risk of developing a
life-threatening pulmonary embolism.
Inspect the lower
extremities bilaterally. Assess for size, color, temperature, and
for presence of pain in the calves. Unilateral warmth, redness,
tenderness, swelling in the calf, or sudden onset of intense,
sharp muscle pain that increases with dorsiflexion of the foot
is an indication of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
See Figure
9.7
for an image  of a DVT in the patientâs right leg, indicated
by unilateral redness and edema.
Auscultation
HEART SOUNDSAuscultation is routinely performed over five specific areas of the heart to
listen for corresponding valvular sounds. These auscultation sites are often
referred to by the mnemonic âAPE To Man,â referring to Aortic, Pulmonic,
Erbâs point, Tricuspid, and Mitral areas (see Figure 9.8
for an illustration of
cardiac auscultation areas). The aortic area is the second intercostal space
to the right of the sternum. The pulmonary area is the second intercostal
space to the left of the sternum. Erbâs point is directly below the aortic
area and located at the third intercostal space to the left of the sternum.
The tricuspid (or parasternal) area is at the fourth intercostal space to the
left of the sternum. The mitral (also called apical or left ventricular area) is
the fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line.
Use the diaphragm of the stethoscope to carefully identify the S1 and S2
sounds.  They will make a âlub-dubâ sound. Note that when listening over
the area of the aortic and pulmonic valves, the âdubâ (S2) will sound louder
than the âlubâ (S1). Move the stethoscope sequentially to the pulmonic
area (upper left sternal edge), Erbâs point (left third intercostal space at the
sternal border), and tricuspid area (fourth intercostal space. When
assessing the mitral area for female patients, it is often helpful to ask them
to lift up their breast tissue so the stethoscope can be placed directly on
the chest wall. Repeat this process with the bell of the stethoscope. The
apical pulse should be counted over a 60-second period. For an adult, the
heart rate should be between 60 and 100 with a regular rhythm to be
considered within normal range. The apical pulse is an important
assessment to obtain before the administration of many cardiac
medications.
The first heart sound (S1) identifies the onset of systole, when the
atrioventricular (AV) valves (mitral and tricuspid) close and the ventricles
contract and eject the blood out of the heart. The second heart sound (S2)
identifies the end of systole and the onset of diastole when the semilunar
valves close, the AV valves open, and the ventricles fill with blood. When
auscultating, it is important to identify the S1 (âlubâ) and S2 (âdubâ) sounds,
evaluate the rate and rhythm of the heart, and listen for any extra heart
sounds.
Auscultating Heart Sounds
â¢  To effectively auscultate heart sounds,
patient repositioning may be required. Ask
the patient to lean forward if able, or
position them to lie on their left side.
â¢  It is common to hear lung sounds when
auscultating the heart sounds. It may be helpful to ask
the patient to briefly hold their breath if lung sounds
impede adequate heart auscultation. Limit the holding
of breath to 10 seconds or as tolerated by the patient.
â¢  Environmental noise can cause difficulty in auscultating
heart sounds. Removing environmental noise by
turning down the television volume or shutting the
door may be required for an accurate assessment.
â¢  Patients may try to talk to you as you are assessing their
heart sounds. It is often helpful to explain the procedure
such as, âI am going to take a few minutes to listen
carefully to the sounds of blood flow going through
your heart. Please try not to speak while I am listening,
so I can hear the sounds better.â
EXTRA HEART SOUNDSExtra heart sounds include clicks, murmurs, S3 and S4 sounds, and pleural
friction rubs. These extra sounds can be difficult for a novice to
distinguish, so if you notice any new or different sounds, consult an
advanced practitioner or notify the provider. A midsystolic click, associated
or left lower sternal border.
A click may be followed by a murmur. A murmur is a blowing or
whooshing sound that signifies turbulent blood flow often caused by a
valvular defect. New murmurs not previously recorded should be
immediately communicated to the health care provider. In the aortic area,
listen for possible murmurs of aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation with
the diaphragm of the stethoscope. In the pulmonic area, listen for
potential murmurs of pulmonic stenosis and pulmonary and aortic
regurgitation. In the tricuspid area, at the fourth and fifth intercostal
spaces along the left sternal border, listen for the potential murmurs of
tricuspid regurgitation, tricuspid stenosis, or ventricular septal defect.
S3 and S4 sounds, if present, are often heard best by asking the patient to
lie on their left side and listening over the apex with the bell of the
stethoscope. An S3 sound, also called a ventricular gallop, occurs with
fluid overload or heart failure when the ventricles are filling.  It occurs after
the S2 and sounds like âlub-dub-dah,â or a sound similar to a horse
galloping. The S4 sound, also called atrial gallop, occurs immediately
before the S1 and sounds like âta-lub-dub.â An S4 sound can occur with
decreased ventricular compliance or coronary artery disease.
A pleural friction rub is caused by inflammation of the pericardium and
sounds like sandpaper being rubbed together. It is best heard at the apex
or left lower sternal border with the diaphragm as the patient sits up,
leans forward, and holds their breath.
CAROTID SOUNDSThe carotid artery may be auscultated for bruits. Bruits are a swishing
sound due to turbulence in the blood vessel and may be heard due to
atherosclerotic changes.
Palpation
Palpation is used to evaluate peripheral pulses, capillary refill, and for the
presence of edema.  When palpating these areas, also pay attention to thetemperature and moisture of the skin.
PULSESCompare the rate, rhythm, and quality of arterial pulses bilaterally,
including the carotid, radial, brachial, posterior tibialis, and dorsalis pedis
pulses. Review additional information about obtaining pulses in theâGeneral Surveyâ chapter. Bilateral comparison for all pulses (except thecarotid) is important for determining subtle variations in pulse strength.
Carotid pulses should be palpated on one side at a time to avoid
decreasing perfusion of the brain. The posterior tibial artery is located just
behind the medial malleolus. It can be palpated by scooping the patientâs
heel in your hand and wrapping your fingers around so that the tips come
to rest on the appropriate area just below the medial malleolus. The
dorsalis pedis artery is located just lateral to the extensor tendon of the big
toe and can be identified by asking the patient to flex their toe while you
provide resistance to this movement. Gently place the tips of your second,
third, and fourth fingers adjacent to the tendon, and try to feel the pulse.
The quality of the pulse is graded on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 being absent
pulses, 1 being decreased pulses, 2 is within normal range, and 3 being
increased (also referred to as âboundingâ). If unable to palpate a pulse,
additional assessment is needed. First, determine if this is a new or
chronic finding. Second, if available, use a doppler ultrasound to
determine the presence or absence of the pulse. Many agencies use
doppler ultrasound to document if a nonpalpable pulse is present. If the
pulse is not found, this could be a sign of an emergent condition requiring
immediate follow-up and provider notification. See Figures 9.9
and 9.10
for images of assessing pedal pulses.
CAPILLARY REFILLThe capillary refill test is performed on the nail beds to monitor perfusion,
the amount of blood flow to tissue. Pressure is applied to a fingernail or
toenail until it pales, indicating that the blood has been forced from the
tissue under the nail. This paleness is called blanching. Once the tissue
has blanched, pressure is removed. Capillary refill time is defined as the
time it takes for the color to return after pressure is removed. If there is
sufficient blood flow to the area, a pink color should return within 2 to 3
seconds after the pressure is removed.
EDEMAEdema occurs when one can visualize visible swelling caused by a buildup
of fluid within the tissues. If edema is present on inspection, palpate the
area to determine if the edema is pitting or nonpitting. Press on the skin
to assess for indentation, ideally over a bony structure, such as the tibia. If
no indentation occurs, it is referred to as nonpitting edema. If indentation
occurs, it is referred to as pitting edema. See Figure 9.11
for images
demonstrating pitting edema.
Note the depth of the indention and how long it takes for the skin to
rebound back to its original position. The indentation and time required to
rebound to the original position are graded on a scale from 1 to 4. Edema
rebound, and 4+ indicates a deep depression with a time lapse of over 20
seconds required to rebound. See Figure 9.12
for an illustration of grading
edema. Additionally, it is helpful to note edema may be difficult to observe
in larger patients. It is also important to monitor for sudden changes in
weight, which is considered a probable sign of fluid volume overload.
HEAVES OR THRILLSYou may observe advanced practice nurses and other health care
providers palpating the anterior chest wall to detect any abnormal
pulsations the underlying cardiac chambers and great vessels may
produce. Precordial movements should be evaluated at the apex (mitral
because if the patient is turned on the left side, the apical region of the
heart is displaced against the lateral chest wall, distorting the chest
movements.
A heave or lift is a palpable lifting sensation under the
sternum and anterior chest wall to the left of the sternum that suggests
severe right ventricular hypertrophy. A thrill is a vibration felt on the skin of
the precordium or over an area of turbulence, such as an arteriovenous
fistula or graft.
Life Span Considerations
The cardiovascular assessment and expected findings should be modified
according to common variations across the life span.
INFANTS AND CHILDRENA murmur may be heard in a newborn in the first few days of life until the
ductus arteriosus closes.
When assessing the cardiovascular system in children, it is important to
assess the apical pulse. Parameters for expected findings vary according
to age group. After a child reaches adolescence, a radial pulse may be
assessed. Table 9.3c outlines the expected apical pulse rate by age.
Table 9.3c Expected Apical Pulse by Age
OLDER ADULTSIn adults over age 65, irregular heart rhythms and extra sounds are more
likely. An âirregularly irregularâ rhythm suggests atrial fibrillation, and
further investigation is required if this is a new finding. See the hyperlink
in the box below for more information about atrial fibrillation.","CHAPTER 9 CARDIOVASCULAR ASSESSMENT 9.3 Cardiovascular Assessment Objective Assessment The physical examination of the cardiovascular system involves the
interpretation of vital signs, inspection, palpation, and auscultation of
heart sounds as the nurse evaluates for sufficient perfusion and cardiac
output.
Equipment needed for a cardiovascular assessment includes a
stethoscope, penlight, centimeter ruler or tape measure, and
sphygmomanometer.
Evaluate Vital Signs and Level of Consciousness
Interpret the blood pressure and pulse readings to verify the patient is
stable before proceeding with the physical exam. Assess the level of
consciousness; the patient should be alert and cooperative.
Inspection
â¢  Skin color to assess perfusion. Inspect the face, lips, and fingertips for
cyanosis or pallor. Cyanosis is a bluish discoloration of the skin, lips,
and nail beds and indicates decreased perfusion and oxygenation.
Pallor is the loss of color, or paleness of the skin or mucous
membranes, as a result of reduced blood flow, oxygenation, or
decreased number of red blood cells. Patients with light skin tones
should be pink in color. For those with darker skin tones, assess for
pallor on the palms, conjunctiva, or inner aspect of the lower lip.
â¢  Jugular Vein Distension (JVD). Inspect the neck for JVD that occurs
when the increased pressure of the superior vena cava causes the
jugular vein to bulge, making it most visible on the right side of a
personâs neck. JVD should not be present in the upright position or
when the head of bed is at 30-45 degrees.
â¢  Precordium for abnormalities. Inspect the chest area over the heart
(also called precordium) for deformities, scars, or any abnormal
pulsations the underlying cardiac chambers and great vessels may
produce.
â¢  Extremities:
â¦  Upper Extremities: Inspect the fingers, arms, and hands bilaterallynoting Color, Warmth, Movement, Sensation (CWMS). Alterations
or bilateral inconsistency in CWMS may indicate underlying
bed until it blanches and record the time taken for the color to
return to the nail bed. Normal capillary refill is less than 3
seconds.
â¦  Lower Extremities: Inspect the toes, feet, and legs bilaterally,noting CWMS, capillary refill, and the presence of peripheral
edema, superficial distended veins, and hair distribution.
Document the location and size of any skin ulcers.
âª  Edema: Note any presence of edema. Peripheral edema isswelling that can be caused by infection, thrombosis, or
venous insufficiency due to an accumulation of fluid in the
tissues. (See Figure 9.6
12 for an image of pedal edema.)
âª  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is
a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body. DVT
requires emergency notification of the health care provider
and immediate follow-up because of the risk of developing a
life-threatening pulmonary embolism.
Inspect the lower
extremities bilaterally. Assess for size, color, temperature, and
for presence of pain in the calves. Unilateral warmth, redness,
tenderness, swelling in the calf, or sudden onset of intense,
sharp muscle pain that increases with dorsiflexion of the foot
is an indication of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
See Figure
9.7
for an image  of a DVT in the patientâs right leg, indicated
by unilateral redness and edema.
Auscultation
HEART SOUNDSAuscultation is routinely performed over five specific areas of the heart to
listen for corresponding valvular sounds. These auscultation sites are often
referred to by the mnemonic âAPE To Man,â referring to Aortic, Pulmonic,
Erbâs point, Tricuspid, and Mitral areas (see Figure 9.8
for an illustration of
cardiac auscultation areas). The aortic area is the second intercostal space
to the right of the sternum. The pulmonary area is the second intercostal
space to the left of the sternum. Erbâs point is directly below the aortic
area and located at the third intercostal space to the left of the sternum.
The tricuspid (or parasternal) area is at the fourth intercostal space to the
left of the sternum. The mitral (also called apical or left ventricular area) is
the fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line.
Use the diaphragm of the stethoscope to carefully identify the S1 and S2
sounds.  They will make a âlub-dubâ sound. Note that when listening over
the area of the aortic and pulmonic valves, the âdubâ (S2) will sound louder
than the âlubâ (S1). Move the stethoscope sequentially to the pulmonic
area (upper left sternal edge), Erbâs point (left third intercostal space at the
sternal border), and tricuspid area (fourth intercostal space. When
assessing the mitral area for female patients, it is often helpful to ask them
to lift up their breast tissue so the stethoscope can be placed directly on
the chest wall. Repeat this process with the bell of the stethoscope. The
apical pulse should be counted over a 60-second period. For an adult, the
heart rate should be between 60 and 100 with a regular rhythm to be
considered within normal range. The apical pulse is an important
assessment to obtain before the administration of many cardiac
medications.
The first heart sound (S1) identifies the onset of systole, when the
atrioventricular (AV) valves (mitral and tricuspid) close and the ventricles
contract and eject the blood out of the heart. The second heart sound (S2)
identifies the end of systole and the onset of diastole when the semilunar
valves close, the AV valves open, and the ventricles fill with blood. When
auscultating, it is important to identify the S1 (âlubâ) and S2 (âdubâ) sounds,
evaluate the rate and rhythm of the heart, and listen for any extra heart
sounds.
Auscultating Heart Sounds
â¢  To effectively auscultate heart sounds,
patient repositioning may be required. Ask
the patient to lean forward if able, or
position them to lie on their left side.
â¢  It is common to hear lung sounds when
auscultating the heart sounds. It may be helpful to ask
the patient to briefly hold their breath if lung sounds
impede adequate heart auscultation. Limit the holding
of breath to 10 seconds or as tolerated by the patient.
â¢  Environmental noise can cause difficulty in auscultating
heart sounds. Removing environmental noise by
turning down the television volume or shutting the
door may be required for an accurate assessment.
â¢  Patients may try to talk to you as you are assessing their
heart sounds. It is often helpful to explain the procedure
such as, âI am going to take a few minutes to listen
carefully to the sounds of blood flow going through
your heart. Please try not to speak while I am listening,
so I can hear the sounds better.â
EXTRA HEART SOUNDSExtra heart sounds include clicks, murmurs, S3 and S4 sounds, and pleural
friction rubs. These extra sounds can be difficult for a novice to
distinguish, so if you notice any new or different sounds, consult an
advanced practitioner or notify the provider. A midsystolic click, associated
or left lower sternal border.
A click may be followed by a murmur. A murmur is a blowing or
whooshing sound that signifies turbulent blood flow often caused by a
valvular defect. New murmurs not previously recorded should be
immediately communicated to the health care provider. In the aortic area,
listen for possible murmurs of aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation with
the diaphragm of the stethoscope. In the pulmonic area, listen for
potential murmurs of pulmonic stenosis and pulmonary and aortic
regurgitation. In the tricuspid area, at the fourth and fifth intercostal
spaces along the left sternal border, listen for the potential murmurs of
tricuspid regurgitation, tricuspid stenosis, or ventricular septal defect.
S3 and S4 sounds, if present, are often heard best by asking the patient to
lie on their left side and listening over the apex with the bell of the
stethoscope. An S3 sound, also called a ventricular gallop, occurs with
fluid overload or heart failure when the ventricles are filling.  It occurs after
the S2 and sounds like âlub-dub-dah,â or a sound similar to a horse
galloping. The S4 sound, also called atrial gallop, occurs immediately
before the S1 and sounds like âta-lub-dub.â An S4 sound can occur with
decreased ventricular compliance or coronary artery disease.
A pleural friction rub is caused by inflammation of the pericardium and
sounds like sandpaper being rubbed together. It is best heard at the apex
or left lower sternal border with the diaphragm as the patient sits up,
leans forward, and holds their breath.
CAROTID SOUNDSThe carotid artery may be auscultated for bruits. Bruits are a swishing
sound due to turbulence in the blood vessel and may be heard due to
atherosclerotic changes.
Palpation
Palpation is used to evaluate peripheral pulses, capillary refill, and for the
presence of edema.  When palpating these areas, also pay attention to thetemperature and moisture of the skin.
PULSESCompare the rate, rhythm, and quality of arterial pulses bilaterally,
including the carotid, radial, brachial, posterior tibialis, and dorsalis pedis
pulses. Review additional information about obtaining pulses in theâGeneral Surveyâ chapter. Bilateral comparison for all pulses (except thecarotid) is important for determining subtle variations in pulse strength.
Carotid pulses should be palpated on one side at a time to avoid
decreasing perfusion of the brain. The posterior tibial artery is located just
behind the medial malleolus. It can be palpated by scooping the patientâs
heel in your hand and wrapping your fingers around so that the tips come
to rest on the appropriate area just below the medial malleolus. The
dorsalis pedis artery is located just lateral to the extensor tendon of the big
toe and can be identified by asking the patient to flex their toe while you
provide resistance to this movement. Gently place the tips of your second,
third, and fourth fingers adjacent to the tendon, and try to feel the pulse.
The quality of the pulse is graded on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 being absent
pulses, 1 being decreased pulses, 2 is within normal range, and 3 being
increased (also referred to as âboundingâ). If unable to palpate a pulse,
additional assessment is needed. First, determine if this is a new or
chronic finding. Second, if available, use a doppler ultrasound to
determine the presence or absence of the pulse. Many agencies use
doppler ultrasound to document if a nonpalpable pulse is present. If the
pulse is not found, this could be a sign of an emergent condition requiring
immediate follow-up and provider notification. See Figures 9.9
and 9.10
for images of assessing pedal pulses.
CAPILLARY REFILLThe capillary refill test is performed on the nail beds to monitor perfusion,
the amount of blood flow to tissue. Pressure is applied to a fingernail or
toenail until it pales, indicating that the blood has been forced from the
tissue under the nail. This paleness is called blanching. Once the tissue
has blanched, pressure is removed. Capillary refill time is defined as the
time it takes for the color to return after pressure is removed. If there is
sufficient blood flow to the area, a pink color should return within 2 to 3
seconds after the pressure is removed.
EDEMAEdema occurs when one can visualize visible swelling caused by a buildup
of fluid within the tissues. If edema is present on inspection, palpate the
area to determine if the edema is pitting or nonpitting. Press on the skin
to assess for indentation, ideally over a bony structure, such as the tibia. If
no indentation occurs, it is referred to as nonpitting edema. If indentation
occurs, it is referred to as pitting edema. See Figure 9.11
for images
demonstrating pitting edema.
Note the depth of the indention and how long it takes for the skin to
rebound back to its original position. The indentation and time required to
rebound to the original position are graded on a scale from 1 to 4. Edema
rebound, and 4+ indicates a deep depression with a time lapse of over 20
seconds required to rebound. See Figure 9.12
for an illustration of grading
edema. Additionally, it is helpful to note edema may be difficult to observe
in larger patients. It is also important to monitor for sudden changes in
weight, which is considered a probable sign of fluid volume overload.
HEAVES OR THRILLSYou may observe advanced practice nurses and other health care
providers palpating the anterior chest wall to detect any abnormal
pulsations the underlying cardiac chambers and great vessels may
produce. Precordial movements should be evaluated at the apex (mitral
because if the patient is turned on the left side, the apical region of the
heart is displaced against the lateral chest wall, distorting the chest
movements.
A heave or lift is a palpable lifting sensation under the
sternum and anterior chest wall to the left of the sternum that suggests
severe right ventricular hypertrophy. A thrill is a vibration felt on the skin of
the precordium or over an area of turbulence, such as an arteriovenous
fistula or graft.
Life Span Considerations
The cardiovascular assessment and expected findings should be modified
according to common variations across the life span.
INFANTS AND CHILDRENA murmur may be heard in a newborn in the first few days of life until the
ductus arteriosus closes.
When assessing the cardiovascular system in children, it is important to
assess the apical pulse. Parameters for expected findings vary according
to age group. After a child reaches adolescence, a radial pulse may be
assessed. Table 9.3c outlines the expected apical pulse rate by age.
Table 9.3c Expected Apical Pulse by Age
OLDER ADULTSIn adults over age 65, irregular heart rhythms and extra sounds are more
likely. An âirregularly irregularâ rhythm suggests atrial fibrillation, and
further investigation is required if this is a new finding. See the hyperlink
in the box below for more information about atrial fibrillation.",3639
CHAPTER 9 CARDIOVASCULAR ASSESSMENT 9.3 Cardiovascular Assessment,"Expected Versus Unexpected Findings After completing a cardiovascular assessment, it is important for the nurse

CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT 10.3 Respiratory Assessment,"Objective Assessment A focused respiratory objective assessment includes interpretation of vital
signs; inspection of the patientâs breathing pattern, skin color, and
respiratory status; palpation to identify abnormalities; and auscultation of
lung sounds using a stethoscope. For more information regardinginterpreting vital signs, see the âGeneral Surveyâ chapter. The nurse musthave an understanding of what is expected for the patientâs age, gender,
development, race, culture, environmental factors, and current health
condition to determine the meaning of the data that is being collected.
Evaluate Vital Signs
The vital signs may be taken by the nurse or delegated to unlicensed
assistive personnel such as a nursing assistant or medical assistant.
Evaluate the respiratory rate and pulse oximetry readings to verify the
patient is stable before proceeding with the physical exam. The normal
range of a respiratory rate for an adult is 12-20 breaths per minute at rest,
and the normal range for oxygen saturation of the blood is 94â98% (SpOâ)
Bradypnea is less than 12 breaths per minute, and tachypnea is greater
than 20 breaths per minute.
Inspection
Inspection during a focused respiratory assessment includes observation
of level of consciousness, breathing rate, pattern and effort, skin color,
chest configuration, and symmetry of expansion.
â¢  Assess the level of consciousness. The patient should be alert and
cooperative.  Hypoxemia (low blood levels of oxygen) or hypercapnia
(high blood levels of carbon dioxide) can cause a decreased level of
consciousness, irritability, anxiousness, restlessness, or confusion.
â¢  Obtain the respiratory rate over a full minute. The normal range for the
respiratory rate of an adult is 12-20 breaths per minute.
â¢  Observe the breathing pattern, including the rhythm, effort, and use
of accessory muscles. Breathing effort should be nonlabored and in a
regular rhythm. Observe the depth of respiration and note if the
respiration is shallow or deep. Pursed-lip breathing, nasal flaring,
audible breathing, intercostal retractions, anxiety, and use of
accessory muscles are signs of respiratory difficulty. Inspiration should
last half as long as expiration unless the patient is active, in which case
the inspiration-expiration ratio increases to 1:1.
â¢  Observe pattern of expiration and patient position. Patients who
experience difficulty expelling air, such as those with emphysema,
may have prolonged expiration cycles. Some patients may experience
difficulty with breathing specifically when lying down. This symptom
is known as orthopnea. Additionally, patients who are experiencing
significant breathing difficulty may experience most relief while in a
âtripodâ position. This can be achieved by having the patient sit at the
side of the bed with legs dangling toward the floor. The patient can
then rest their arms on an overbed table to allow for maximum lung
expansion. This position mimics the same position you might take at
the end of running a race when you lean over and place your hands on
your knees to âcatch your breath.â
â¢  Observe the patientâs color in their lips, face, hands, and feet. Patients
with light skin tones should be pink in color. For those with darker skin
tones, assess for pallor on the palms, conjunctivae, or inner aspect of
beds, which may indicate decreased perfusion and oxygenation. Pallor
is the loss of color, or paleness of the skin or mucous membranes and
usually the result of reduced blood flow, oxygenation, or decreased
number of red blood cells.
â¢  Inspect the chest for symmetry and configuration. The trachea should
be midline, and the clavicles should be symmetrical. See Figure 10.2
for visual landmarks when inspecting the thorax anteriorly, posteriorly,
and laterally. Note the location of the ribs, sternum, clavicle, and
scapula, as well as the underlying lobes of the lungs.
â¦  Chest movement should be symmetrical on inspiration and
expiration.
â¦  Observe the anterior-posterior diameter of the patientâs chest and
compare to the transverse diameter. The expected
anteroposterior-transverse ratio should be 1:2. A patient with a 1:1
ratio is described as barrel-chested. This ratio is often seen in
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to
hyperinflation of the lungs. See Figure 10.3
for an image of a
patient with a barrel chest.
â¦  Older patients may have changes in their anatomy, such as
kyphosis, an outward curvature of the spine.
â¢  Inspect the fingers for clubbing if the patient has a history of chronic
respiratory disease. Clubbing is a bulbous enlargement of the tips of
for an image ofthe fingers due to chronic hypoxia. See Figure 10.4
clubbing.
Palpation
abnormality related to injury or procedural complications. For
example, if a patient has a chest tube or has recently had one
removed, the nurse may palpate near the tube insertion site to assess
for areas of air leak or crepitus. Crepitus feels like a popping or
crackling sensation when the skin is palpated and is a sign of air
trapped under the subcutaneous tissues. If palpating the chest, use
light pressure with the fingertips to examine the anterior and
posterior chest wall. Chest palpation may be performed to assess
specifically for growths, masses, crepitus, pain, or tenderness.
â¢  Confirm symmetric chest expansion by placing your hands on the
anterior or posterior chest at the same level, with thumbs over the
sternum anteriorly or the spine posteriorly. As the patient inhales, your
thumbs should move apart symmetrically. Unequal expansion can
occur with pneumonia, thoracic trauma, such as fractured ribs, or
pneumothorax.
Auscultation
Using the diaphragm of the stethoscope, listen to the movement of air
through the airways during inspiration and expiration. Instruct the patient
to take deep breaths through their mouth. Listen through the entire
respiratory cycle because different sounds may be heard on inspiration
and expiration. As you move across the different lung fields, the sounds
because the size of the airways change.
Correct placement of the stethoscope during auscultation of lung sounds
is important to obtain a quality assessment. The stethoscope should not
be performed over clothes or hair because these may create inaccurate
sounds from friction. The best position to listen to lung sounds is with the
patient sitting upright; however, if the patient is acutely ill or unable to sit
upright, turn them side to side in a lying position. Avoid listening over
bones, such as the scapulae or clavicles or over the female breasts to
ensure you are hearing adequate sound transmission. Listen to sounds
from side to side rather than down one side and then down the other side.
This side-to-side pattern allows you to compare sounds in symmetrical
lung fields. See Figures 10.5
and 10.6
for landmarks of stethoscope
placement over the anterior and posterior chest wall.
EXPECTED BREATH SOUNDSIt is important upon auscultation to have awareness of expected breath
sounds in various anatomical locations.
â¢  Bronchial breath sounds are heard over the trachea and larynx and
are high-pitched and loud.
â¢  Bronchovesicular sounds are medium-pitched and heard over the
major bronchi.
â¢  Vesicular breath sounds are heard over the lung surfaces, are lower-
pitched, and often described as soft, rustling sounds.
ADVENTITIOUS LUNG SOUNDSAdventitious lung sounds are sounds heard in addition to normal breath
sounds. They most often indicate an airway problem or disease, such as
accumulation of mucus or fluids in the airways, obstruction, inflammation,
or infection. These sounds include rales/crackles, rhonchi/wheezes, stridor,
and pleural rub:
â¢  Fine crackles, also called rales, are popping or crackling sounds heard
on inspiration that occur in association with conditions that cause
fluid to accumulate within the alveolar and interstitial spaces, such as
heart failure or pneumonia. The sound is similar to that produced by
rubbing strands of hair together close to your ear.
â¢  Wheezes are whistling-type noises produced during expiration (and
sometimes inspiration) when air is forced through airways narrowed
by bronchoconstriction or associated mucosal edema. For example,
patients with asthma commonly have wheezing.
â¢  Stridor is heard only on inspiration. It is associated with mechanical
obstruction at the level of the trachea/upper airway.
â¢  Pleural rub may be heard on either inspiration or expiration and
sounds like the rubbing together of leather. A pleural rub is heard
the surfaces rub against each other.
Life Span Considerations
CHILDRENThere are various respiratory assessment considerations that should be
noted with assessment of children.
â¢  The respiratory rate in children less than 12 months of age can range
from 30-60 breaths per minute, depending on whether the infant is
asleep or active.
â¢  Infants have irregular or periodic newborn breathing in the first few
weeks of life; therefore, it is important to count the respirations for a
full minute. During this time, you may notice periods of apnea lasting
up to 10 seconds. This is not abnormal unless the infant is showing
other signs of distress. Signs of respiratory distress in infants and
children include nasal flaring and sternal or intercostal retractions.
â¢  Up to three months of age, infants are considered âobligateâ nose-
breathers, meaning their breathing is primarily through the nose.
â¢  The anteroposterior-transverse ratio is typically 1:1 until the thoracic
muscles are fully developed around six years of age.
OLDER ADULTSAs the adult person ages, the cartilage and muscle support of the thoraxbecomes weakened and less flexible, resulting in a decrease in chest
expansion. Older adults may also have weakened respiratory muscles, and
breathing may become more shallow. The anteroposterior-transverse ratio
may be 1:1 if there is significant curvature of the spine (kyphosis).
Percussion
Percussion is an advanced respiratory assessment technique that is used
by advanced practice nurses and other health care providers to gather
additional data in the underlying lung tissue. By striking the fingers of one
hand over the fingers of the other hand, a sound is produced over the
lung fields that helps determine if fluid is present. Dull sounds are heard
with high-density areas, such as pneumonia or atelectasis, whereas clear,
low-pitched, hollow sounds are heard in normal lung tissue.
â¢  Because infants breathe primarily through
the nose, nasal congestion can limit the
amount of air getting into the lungs.
â¢  Attempt to assess an infantâs respiratory
rate while the infant is at rest and content
rather than when the infant is crying.
Counting respirations by observing abdominal
breathing movements may be easier for the novice
nurse than counting breath sounds, as it can be difficult
to differentiate lung and heart sounds when
auscultating newborns.
â¢  Auscultation of lungs during crying is not a problem. It
will enhance breath sounds.
â¢  The older patient may have a weakening of muscles
that support respiration and breathing. Therefore, the
when taking deep breaths. Break up the assessment by
listening to the anterior lung sounds and then the heart
sounds and allowing the patient to rest before listening
to the posterior lung sounds.
â¢  Patients with end-stage COPD may have diminished
lung sounds due to decreased air movement. This
abnormal assessment finding may be the patientâs
baseline or normal and might also include wheezes and
fine crackles as a result of chronic excess secretions
and/or bronchoconstriction.","CHAPTER 10 RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT 10.3 Respiratory Assessment Objective Assessment A focused respiratory objective assessment includes interpretation of vital
signs; inspection of the patientâs breathing pattern, skin color, and
respiratory status; palpation to identify abnormalities; and auscultation of
lung sounds using a stethoscope. For more information regardinginterpreting vital signs, see the âGeneral Surveyâ chapter. The nurse musthave an understanding of what is expected for the patientâs age, gender,
development, race, culture, environmental factors, and current health
condition to determine the meaning of the data that is being collected.
Evaluate Vital Signs
The vital signs may be taken by the nurse or delegated to unlicensed
assistive personnel such as a nursing assistant or medical assistant.
Evaluate the respiratory rate and pulse oximetry readings to verify the
patient is stable before proceeding with the physical exam. The normal
range of a respiratory rate for an adult is 12-20 breaths per minute at rest,
and the normal range for oxygen saturation of the blood is 94â98% (SpOâ)
Bradypnea is less than 12 breaths per minute, and tachypnea is greater
than 20 breaths per minute.
Inspection
Inspection during a focused respiratory assessment includes observation
of level of consciousness, breathing rate, pattern and effort, skin color,
chest configuration, and symmetry of expansion.
â¢  Assess the level of consciousness. The patient should be alert and
cooperative.  Hypoxemia (low blood levels of oxygen) or hypercapnia
(high blood levels of carbon dioxide) can cause a decreased level of
consciousness, irritability, anxiousness, restlessness, or confusion.
â¢  Obtain the respiratory rate over a full minute. The normal range for the
respiratory rate of an adult is 12-20 breaths per minute.
â¢  Observe the breathing pattern, including the rhythm, effort, and use
of accessory muscles. Breathing effort should be nonlabored and in a
regular rhythm. Observe the depth of respiration and note if the
respiration is shallow or deep. Pursed-lip breathing, nasal flaring,
audible breathing, intercostal retractions, anxiety, and use of
accessory muscles are signs of respiratory difficulty. Inspiration should
last half as long as expiration unless the patient is active, in which case
the inspiration-expiration ratio increases to 1:1.
â¢  Observe pattern of expiration and patient position. Patients who
experience difficulty expelling air, such as those with emphysema,
may have prolonged expiration cycles. Some patients may experience
difficulty with breathing specifically when lying down. This symptom
is known as orthopnea. Additionally, patients who are experiencing
significant breathing difficulty may experience most relief while in a
âtripodâ position. This can be achieved by having the patient sit at the
side of the bed with legs dangling toward the floor. The patient can
then rest their arms on an overbed table to allow for maximum lung
expansion. This position mimics the same position you might take at
the end of running a race when you lean over and place your hands on
your knees to âcatch your breath.â
â¢  Observe the patientâs color in their lips, face, hands, and feet. Patients
with light skin tones should be pink in color. For those with darker skin
tones, assess for pallor on the palms, conjunctivae, or inner aspect of
beds, which may indicate decreased perfusion and oxygenation. Pallor
is the loss of color, or paleness of the skin or mucous membranes and
usually the result of reduced blood flow, oxygenation, or decreased
number of red blood cells.
â¢  Inspect the chest for symmetry and configuration. The trachea should
be midline, and the clavicles should be symmetrical. See Figure 10.2
for visual landmarks when inspecting the thorax anteriorly, posteriorly,
and laterally. Note the location of the ribs, sternum, clavicle, and
scapula, as well as the underlying lobes of the lungs.
â¦  Chest movement should be symmetrical on inspiration and
expiration.
â¦  Observe the anterior-posterior diameter of the patientâs chest and
compare to the transverse diameter. The expected
anteroposterior-transverse ratio should be 1:2. A patient with a 1:1
ratio is described as barrel-chested. This ratio is often seen in
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to
hyperinflation of the lungs. See Figure 10.3
for an image of a
patient with a barrel chest.
â¦  Older patients may have changes in their anatomy, such as
kyphosis, an outward curvature of the spine.
â¢  Inspect the fingers for clubbing if the patient has a history of chronic
respiratory disease. Clubbing is a bulbous enlargement of the tips of
for an image ofthe fingers due to chronic hypoxia. See Figure 10.4
clubbing.
Palpation
abnormality related to injury or procedural complications. For
example, if a patient has a chest tube or has recently had one
removed, the nurse may palpate near the tube insertion site to assess
for areas of air leak or crepitus. Crepitus feels like a popping or
crackling sensation when the skin is palpated and is a sign of air
trapped under the subcutaneous tissues. If palpating the chest, use
light pressure with the fingertips to examine the anterior and
posterior chest wall. Chest palpation may be performed to assess
specifically for growths, masses, crepitus, pain, or tenderness.
â¢  Confirm symmetric chest expansion by placing your hands on the
anterior or posterior chest at the same level, with thumbs over the
sternum anteriorly or the spine posteriorly. As the patient inhales, your
thumbs should move apart symmetrically. Unequal expansion can
occur with pneumonia, thoracic trauma, such as fractured ribs, or
pneumothorax.
Auscultation
Using the diaphragm of the stethoscope, listen to the movement of air
through the airways during inspiration and expiration. Instruct the patient
to take deep breaths through their mouth. Listen through the entire
respiratory cycle because different sounds may be heard on inspiration
and expiration. As you move across the different lung fields, the sounds
because the size of the airways change.
Correct placement of the stethoscope during auscultation of lung sounds
is important to obtain a quality assessment. The stethoscope should not
be performed over clothes or hair because these may create inaccurate
sounds from friction. The best position to listen to lung sounds is with the
patient sitting upright; however, if the patient is acutely ill or unable to sit
upright, turn them side to side in a lying position. Avoid listening over
bones, such as the scapulae or clavicles or over the female breasts to
ensure you are hearing adequate sound transmission. Listen to sounds
from side to side rather than down one side and then down the other side.
This side-to-side pattern allows you to compare sounds in symmetrical
lung fields. See Figures 10.5
and 10.6
for landmarks of stethoscope
placement over the anterior and posterior chest wall.
EXPECTED BREATH SOUNDSIt is important upon auscultation to have awareness of expected breath
sounds in various anatomical locations.
â¢  Bronchial breath sounds are heard over the trachea and larynx and
are high-pitched and loud.
â¢  Bronchovesicular sounds are medium-pitched and heard over the
major bronchi.
â¢  Vesicular breath sounds are heard over the lung surfaces, are lower-
pitched, and often described as soft, rustling sounds.
ADVENTITIOUS LUNG SOUNDSAdventitious lung sounds are sounds heard in addition to normal breath
sounds. They most often indicate an airway problem or disease, such as
accumulation of mucus or fluids in the airways, obstruction, inflammation,
or infection. These sounds include rales/crackles, rhonchi/wheezes, stridor,
and pleural rub:
â¢  Fine crackles, also called rales, are popping or crackling sounds heard
on inspiration that occur in association with conditions that cause
fluid to accumulate within the alveolar and interstitial spaces, such as
heart failure or pneumonia. The sound is similar to that produced by
rubbing strands of hair together close to your ear.
â¢  Wheezes are whistling-type noises produced during expiration (and
sometimes inspiration) when air is forced through airways narrowed
by bronchoconstriction or associated mucosal edema. For example,
patients with asthma commonly have wheezing.
â¢  Stridor is heard only on inspiration. It is associated with mechanical
obstruction at the level of the trachea/upper airway.
â¢  Pleural rub may be heard on either inspiration or expiration and
sounds like the rubbing together of leather. A pleural rub is heard
the surfaces rub against each other.

The air we breathe contains 21% oxygen and is crucial for life. Several body
systems must work collaboratively during the oxygenation process to take
in oxygen from the air, carry it through the bloodstream, and adequatelyoxygenate tissues. First, the airway must be open and clear. The chest and
lungs must mechanically move air in and out of the lungs. The bronchial
airways must be open and clear so that air can reach the alveoli, where
oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is released
during exhalation. The heart must effectively pump this oxygenated blood
to and from the lungs and through the systemic arteries. The hemoglobin
in the blood must be in adequate amounts to sufficiently carry the oxygen
to the tissues, where it is released and carbon dioxide is absorbed and
carried back to the lungs.
Several medical conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, heart disease, and anemia can
impair a personâs ability to sufficiently complete this oxygenation process,
thus requiring the administration of supplemental oxygen. This chapter
will review basic concepts related to oxygenation, provide an overview of
oxygenation equipment, and apply the nursing process to the
administration of supplemental oxygen. Oxygen is considered a
medication and, therefore, requires a prescription and continuous

CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY 11.2 Basic Concepts of Oxygenation,"Hypoxia and Hypercapnia Hypoxia is defined as a reduced level of tissue oxygenation. Hypoxia has
many causes, ranging from respiratory and cardiac conditions to anemia.
Hypoxemia is a specific type of hypoxia that is defined as decreased
partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PaO2), measured by an arterial
blood gas (ABG).
Early signs of hypoxia are anxiety, confusion, and restlessness. As hypoxia
worsens, the patientâs level of consciousness and vital signs will worsen,
with increased respiratory rate and heart rate and decreased pulse
oximetry readings. Late signs of hypoxia include bluish discoloration of the
skin and mucous membranes called cyanosis. Cyanosis is most easily seen
around the lips and in the oral mucosa. A sign of chronic hypoxia is
clubbing, a gradual enlargement of the fingertips (see Figure 11.1
). See
Table 11.2b for symptoms and signs of hypoxia.
Hypercapnia is an elevated level of carbon dioxide in the blood. This level
is measured by the PaCO2 level in an ABG test and is indicated when the
PaCO2 level is higher than 45. Hypercapnia is typically caused by
hypoventilation or areas of the alveoli that are ventilated but not perfused.
In a state of hypercapnia or hypoventilation, there is an accumulation of
carbon dioxide in the blood. The increased carbon dioxide causes the pH
of the blood to drop, leading to a state of respiratory acidosis. You can read
more about respiratory acidosis in the âFluids and Electrolytesâ chapter of
the Open RN Nursing Fundamentals book. Patients with hypercapnia can
present with tachycardia, dyspnea, flushed skin, confusion, headaches,
and dizziness. If the hypercapnia develops gradually over time, such as in a
patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), symptoms
may be mild or may not be present at all. Hypercapnia is managed by
addressing its underlying cause. A noninvasive positive pressure device
such as a BiPAP may provide support to patients who are having trouble
breathing normally, but if this is not sufficient, intubation may be
required.

CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY 11.2 Basic Concepts of Oxygenation,"Treating Hypoxia Acute hypoxia is a medical emergency and should be treated promptly
with oxygen therapy. Failure to initiate oxygen therapy when needed can
result in serious harm or death of the patient. Although oxygen is
considered a medication that requires a prescription, oxygen therapy may
be initiated without a physicianâs order in emergency situations as part of
the nurseâs response to the âABCs,â a common abbreviation for airway,
breathing, and circulation. Most agencies have a protocol in place that
allows nurses to apply oxygen in emergency situations. After applying
oxygen as needed, the nurse then contacts the provider, respiratory
therapist, or rapid response team, depending on the severity of hypoxia.
Devices such high flow oxymasks, CPAP, BiPAP, or mechanical ventilation
may be initiated by the respiratory therapist or provider to deliver higher
amounts of inspired oxygen.  Various types of oxygenation devices arefurther explained in the âOxygenation Equipmentâ section.
Prescription orders for oxygen therapy will include two measurements of
oxygen to be delivered â the oxygen flow rate and the fraction of inspired
oxygen (FiO2). The oxygen flow rate is the number dialed up on the oxygen
flow meter between 1 L/minute and 15 L/minute. Fio2 is the concentration
concentration, so the FiO2 for supplementary oxygen therapy will range
from 21% to 100% concentration.
In addition to administering oxygen therapy, there are several other
interventions the nurse should consider implementing to a hypoxic
patient. Additional interventions used to treat hypoxia in conjunction with
oxygen therapy are outlined in Table 11.2c.
Table 11.2c  Interventions to Manage Hypoxia
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the most common type of
sleep apnea. See Figure 11.2
for an illustration of OSA. As soft
tissue falls to the back of the throat, it impedes the passage
of air (blue arrows) through the trachea and is characterized
by repeated episodes of complete or partial obstructions of
the upper airway during sleep. The episodes of breathing
cessations are called âapneas,â meaning âwithout breath.â
Despite the effort to breathe, apneas are associated with a
reduction in blood oxygen saturation due to the obstruction
of the airway. Treatment for OSA often includes the use of a
CPAP device.","CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY 11.2 Basic Concepts of Oxygenation Treating Hypoxia Acute hypoxia is a medical emergency and should be treated promptly

cessations are called âapneas,â meaning âwithout breath.â
Despite the effort to breathe, apneas are associated with a
reduction in blood oxygen saturation due to the obstruction
of the airway. Treatment for OSA often includes the use of a
CPAP device.",598
CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY 11.2 Basic Concepts of Oxygenation,"Enhanced Breathing and Coughing Techniques In addition to oxygen therapy and the interventions listed in Table 11.2c to
implement for a patient experiencing dyspnea and hypoxia, there are
several techniques a nurse can teach a patient to use to enhance their
breathing and coughing. These techniques include pursed-lip breathing,
incentive spirometry, coughing and deep breathing, and the huffing
technique.
Pursed-Lip Breathing
Pursed-lip breathing is a technique that allows people to control their
oxygenation and ventilation. The technique requires a person to inspire
through the nose and exhale through the mouth at a slow controlled flow.
See Figure 11.3
for an illustration of pursed-lip breathing. This type of
exhalation gives the person a puckered or pursed appearance. By
prolonging the expiratory phase of respiration, a small amount of positive
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is created in the airways that helps to keep
them open so that more air can be exhaled, thus reducing air trapping
that occurs in some conditions such as COPD. Pursed-lip breathing often
relieves the feeling of shortness of breath, decreases the work of
breathing, and improves gas exchange. People also regain a sense of
control over their breathing while simultaneously increasing their
relaxation.

Breathing Techniques
Incentive Spirometry
An incentive spirometer is a medical device often prescribed after surgery
to prevent and treat atelectasis. Atelectasis occurs when alveoli become
deflated or filled with fluid and can lead to pneumonia. See Figure 11.4
for
an image of a patient using an incentive spirometer. While sitting upright,
the patient should breathe in slowly and deeply through the tubing with
the goal of raising the piston to a specified level. The patient should
attempt to hold their breath for 5 seconds, or as long as tolerated, and
then rest for a few seconds. This technique should be repeated by the16 The nurse may delegate this
patient 10 times every hour while awake.intervention to unlicensed assistive personnel, but the frequency in which
it is completed and the volume achieved should be documented and
monitored by the nurse.
Coughing and Deep Breathing
Teaching the coughing and deep breathing technique is similar to
incentive spirometry but no device is required. The patient is encouraged
to take deep, slow breaths and then exhale slowly. After each set of
breaths, the patient should cough. This technique is repeated 3 to 5 times
every hour.
Huffing Technique
The huffing technique is helpful for patients who have difficulty coughing.
Teach the patient to inhale with a medium-sized breath and then make a
sound like âHaâ to push the air out quickly with the mouth slightly open.
Vibratory PEP Therapy
Vibratory Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) therapy uses handheld
devices such as âflutter valvesâ or âAcapellaâ devices for patients who need
assistance in clearing mucus from their airways. These devices (see Figure17) require a prescription and are used in collaboration with a respiratorytherapist or advanced health care provider. To use Vibratory PEP therapy,
11.5
the patient should sit up, take a deep breath, and blow into the device.  A
flutter valve within the device creates vibrations that help break up the
amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is created in the
airways that helps to keep them open so that more air can be exhaled.

an underlying respiratory condition is above 92%. The pulse oximeter
analyzes light produced by the probe as it passes through the finger to
determine the saturation level of the hemoglobin molecule. Pulse
oximeter probes can be attached to a patientâs finger, forehead, nose, foot,

CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY 11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,"Portable Oxygen Supply Devices Portable oxygen tanks are commonly used when transporting a patient to
for anprocedures within the hospital or to other agencies. See Figure 11.8

the tank in a similar manner as the wall-mounted oxygen flow meter. It is
crucial for nurses and transporters to ensure the tank has an adequate
amount of oxygen for use during transport, is turned on, and the
appropriate flow rate is set.
Instead of oxygen tanks, oxygen concentrators are commonly used by
patients in their home environment. See Figure 11.9
for an image of a
home oxygen concentrator. Oxygen concentrators are also produced in
portable sizes that are lightweight and easy for patient use while travelling
and mobile in the community. See Figure 11.10
for an image of a portable
oxygen concentrator. Oxygen concentrators work by taking the 21%
concentration of oxygen in the air, running it through a molecular sleeve
to remove the nitrogen and concentrating the oxygen to a 96% level, thus
producing between 1 and 6 liters per minute of oxygen. Oxygen
concentrators may provide pulse flow or continuous flow. Pulse flow only
occurs on inhalation, whereas continuous flow delivers oxygen throughout
the entire breath cycle. Pulse versions are the most lightweight because

CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY 11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,"Nasal Cannula A nasal cannula is the simplest oxygenation device and consists of oxygen
tubing connected to two short prongs that are inserted into the patientâs
nares. See Figure 11.11
for an image of a nasal cannula. The tubing is
connected to the flow meter of the oxygen supply source. To prevent
drying out the patientâs mucus membranes, humidification may be added
for hospitalized patients receiving oxygen flow rates greater than 4 L/
minute or for those receiving oxygen therapy for longer periods of time.
Nasal cannulas are the most common type of oxygen equipment. They are
used for short- and long-term therapy (i.e., COPD patients) and are best
used with stable patients who require low amounts of oxygen.
Flow rate: Nasal cannulas can have a flow rate ranging from 1 to 5 liters
per minute (L/min), with a 4% increase in FiO2 for every liter of oxygen,
resulting in range of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) levels of 24-44%.
Advantages: Nasal cannulas are easy to use, inexpensive, and disposable.
They are convenient because the patient can talk and eat while receiving
oxygen.
Limitations: The nasal prongs of nasal cannula are easily dislodged,
especially when the patient is sleeping. The tubing placed on the face can
cause skin breakdown in the nose and above the ears, so the nurse must
vigilantly monitor these areas. Based on agency policy, the nurse should
add padding to the oxygen tubing as needed to avoid skin breakdown and
may apply a water-based lubricant to prevent drying. However,
petroleum-based lubricant should not be used due to the risk of
flammability. Nasal cannulas are not as effective if the patient is a mouth
breather or has blocked nostrils, a deviated septum, or nasal polyps.
High-Flow Nasal Cannula
High-flow nasal cannula therapy is an oxygen supply system capable of
delivering up to 100% humidified and heated oxygen at a flow rate of up to
60 liters per minute.
Patients with high-flow nasal cannulas are generally
in critical condition and require advanced monitoring. See Figure 11.12

CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY 11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,"Simple Mask A simple mask fits over the mouth and nose of the patient and contains
exhalation ports (i.e., holes on the side of the mask) through which the
patient exhales carbon dioxide. These holes should always remain open.
The mask is held in place by an elastic band placed around the back of the
head. It also has a metal piece near the top that can be pinched and
shaped over the patientâs nose to create a better fit. Humidified air may be
attached if the oxygen concentrations are drying for the patient. See
Figure 11.13

Flow Rate: Simple masks should be set to a flow rate of 6 to 10 L/min,
resulting in oxygen concentration (FiO2) levels of 35%-50%. The flow rate
should never be set below 6 L/min because this can result in the patient
rebreathing their exhaled carbon dioxide.
Advantages: Face masks are used to provide moderate oxygen
concentrations. Their efficiency in oxygen delivery depends on how well
the mask fits and the patientâs respiratory demands.
Disadvantages: Face masks must be removed when eating, and they may
feel confining for some patients who feel claustrophobic with the mask

is attached with tubing to a flow meter. See Figure 11.14
for an image of a
non-rebreather mask. It has a series of one-way valves between the mask
and the bag and also on the covers on the exhalation ports. The reservoir
bag should never totally deflate; if the bag deflates, there is a problem and
immediate intervention is required. The one-way valves function so that
on inspiration, the patient only breathes in from the reservoir bag; on
exhalation, carbon dioxide is directed out through the exhalation ports.
Non-rebreather masks are used for patients who can breathe on their own
but require higher concentrations of oxygen to maintain satisfactory blood
oxygenation levels.
Flow rate: The flow rate for a non-rebreather mask should be set to deliver
a minimum of 10 to 15 L/minute. The reservoir bag should be inflated prior
to placing the mask on the patient. With a good fit, the non-rebreather
mask can deliver between 60% and 80% FiO2.
Advantages: Non-rebreather masks deliver high levels of oxygen
noninvasively to patients who can otherwise breathe unassisted.
Disadvantages: Due to the one-way valves in non-rebreather masks, there
is a high risk of suffocation if the gas flow is interrupted. The mask requires

CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY 11.3 Oxygenation Equipment,"Bag Valve Mask (Ambu Bag) A bag valve mask, commonly known as an âAmbu bag,â is a handheld
device used in emergency situations for patients who are not breathing
(respiratory arrest) or who are not breathing adequately (respiratory
failure). In this manner, this device is different from the other devicesbecause it assists with ventilation, the movement of air into and out of the
lungs, as well as oxygenation. See Figure 11.17
for an image of a bag valve
mask. Bag valve masks are produced in different sizes for infants, children,
and adults to prevent lung injury, so it is important to use the correct size
for the patient.
When using a bag mask valve, the rescuer manually compresses the bag
to force air into the lungs. Squeezing the bag once every 5 to 6 seconds for
an adult or once every 3 seconds for an infant or child provides an
adequate respiratory rate. In inpatient settings, the bag mask valve is
attached to an oxygen supply to increase the concentration of
oxygenation provided with each breath. See Figure 11.18
for an illustration
of operating a bag valve mask.
It is vital to obtain a tight seal of the mask to the patientâs face, but this is
difficult for a single rescuer to achieve. Therefore, two rescuers are
recommended; one rescuer performs a jaw thrust maneuver, secures themask to the patientâs face with both hands, and focuses on maintaining a
leak-proof mask seal, while the other rescuer squeezes the bag and
focuses on the amount and the timing.
Flow rate: The flow rate for a bag valve mask attached to an oxygen source
should be set to 15 L/minute, resulting in FiO2 of 100%.
Advantages: A bag valve mask is portable and provides immediate
assistance to patients in respiratory failure or respiratory arrest. It also can
be used to hyperoxygenate patients before procedures that can cause
hypoxia, such as tracheal suctioning.
Disadvantages: The rate and depth of compression of the bag must be
closely monitored to prevent injury to the patient.  In the event of
respiratory failure when the patient is still breathing, the bag
compressions must be coordinated with the patientâs inhalations to
ensure that oxygen is delivered and asynchrony of breaths is prevented.
Complications may also result from overinflating or overpressurizing the
patient. Complications include lung injury or the inflation of the stomach
that can lead to aspiration of stomach contents. Additionally, rescuers may
tire after a few minutes of manually compressing the bag, resulting in less
than optimal ventilation. Alternatively, an endotracheal tube (ET) can be
inserted by an advanced practitioner to substitute for the mask portion of
this device. See more information about endotracheal tubes below.","CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY 11.3 Oxygenation Equipment Bag Valve Mask (Ambu Bag) A bag valve mask, commonly known as an âAmbu bag,â is a handheld
device used in emergency situations for patients who are not breathing
(respiratory arrest) or who are not breathing adequately (respiratory
failure). In this manner, this device is different from the other devicesbecause it assists with ventilation, the movement of air into and out of the
lungs, as well as oxygenation. See Figure 11.17
for an image of a bag valve
mask. Bag valve masks are produced in different sizes for infants, children,
and adults to prevent lung injury, so it is important to use the correct size
for the patient.
When using a bag mask valve, the rescuer manually compresses the bag
to force air into the lungs. Squeezing the bag once every 5 to 6 seconds for
an adult or once every 3 seconds for an infant or child provides an
adequate respiratory rate. In inpatient settings, the bag mask valve is
attached to an oxygen supply to increase the concentration of
oxygenation provided with each breath. See Figure 11.18
for an illustration
of operating a bag valve mask.

based on the severity of the patientâs dyspnea. See Table 11.4 for focused
interview questions related to oxygen therapy. This information is used to
customize the oxygen delivery device and flow rate for the patient. For
example, supplemental oxygen is typically initiated in nonemergency
situations with a nasal cannula at 1-2 liters per minute (L/min), but a
patient with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
may require a different device such as a Venturi mask.

CHAPTER 11 OXYGEN THERAPY 11.4 Nursing Process Related to Oxygen Therapy,"Objective Assessment Prior to applying supplemental oxygen, objective data regarding patient
status should quickly be obtained such as airway clearance, respiratory
rate, pulse oximetry, and lung sounds. Signs of cyanosis in the skin or nail
bed assessment should also be noted. Within a few minutes after
initiating oxygen administration, the nurse should evaluate for
improvement of these indicators, and if no improvement is noted, then
additional actions should be taken. At any point, if the nurse feels that the
patientâs condition is deteriorating, emergency action should be taken
such as calling the rapid response team or 911.
Depending upon the severity of patient condition, serial ABG results may
also be monitored to determine effectiveness of oxygenation
interventions.
After oxygen therapy is initiated, it is important to closely monitor for skin
breakdown at pressure points. For example, nasal cannula tubing often
causes skin breakdown in the nares or over the ears, so protective foam
dressings may need to be applied.
Life Span Considerations
CHILDRENDifferent sized oxygen equipment is used for infants and children.
Additionally, oxygen tubing may need to be secured to a childâs face with
tape to prevent them from pulling it off. For infants, the pulse oximeter
probe is usually attached to the palm or foot.
OLDER ADULTSIf a patient is oxygen-dependent, ensure that extension tubing is applied
so the patient is able to reach the bathroom with the oxygen device in
place. However, be aware of the increased risk for falls due to the excess
tubing. Keeping the oxygen tubing coiled up at the head of the bed or on
the bedside table closest to the bathroom will decrease the patientâs risk
of falling. Advise the patient to ask for assistance when getting up to use
the restroom.
â¢  Safety Tip: When oxygen is in use, teach the patient
about safety considerations with oxygen use because it
is very flammable. See the âSafety with Oxygen Therapyâ
section in âOxygenation Equipmentâ for more details.
â¢  After administering oxygen, instruct the patient to
inhale through their nose with slow, deep breaths and
to breathe out through their mouth.

decreased oxygen saturation levels compared to theirbaseline levels, apply oxygen and stay with the patient
until their oxygen saturation level increases and they
report feeling less short of breath. Providing a physical
presence is an important intervention for the associated
anxiety that accompanies dyspnea. Consider asking a
team member for assistance.

Table 12.3a  Interview Questions for Subjective Assessment of GI and GU
Systems
Gastrointestinal
Pain is the most common complaint related to abdominal problems and
can be attributed to multiple underlying etiologies. Because of the
assessment of this chief complaint should occur. Additional associated
questions include asking if bloody stools (hematochezia); dark, tarry stools
( melena); bloating (abdominal distention); or vomiting of blood
(hematemesis) are occurring.
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are common issues
experienced by hospitalized patients due to adverse effects of medications
or medical procedures. Read more details about commonly occurringgastrointestinal conditions in the âEliminationâ chapter in Open RNNursing Fundamentals. It is important to ask a hospitalized patient daily
about the date of their last bowel movement and flatus so that a bowel
management program can be initiated if necessary. If a patient is
experiencing diarrhea, it is important to assess and monitor for signs of
dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.  Dehydration can be indicated by
dry skin, dry mucous membranes, or sunken eyes. These symptoms may
require contacting the health care provider for further treatment. Read
additional information about fluid and electrolyte imbalances in the
âFluids and Electrolytesâ chapter in Open RN Nursing Fundamentals.
Additional specialized assessments of GI system function can include
examination of the oropharynx and esophagus. For example, patients who
have experienced a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), also called a âstroke,â
may experience difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). The nurse is often the
first to notice these difficulties when swallowing pills, liquid, or food and
can advocate for treatment to prevent complications, such as unintended
weight loss or aspiration pneumonia.
Genitourinary
The nursing assessment of the genitourinary system generally focuses on
bladder function. Ask about urinary symptoms, including dysuria, urinary
frequency, or urinary urgency. Dysuria is any discomfort associated with
urination and often signifies a urinary tract infection. Patients with dysuria
commonly experience burning, stinging, or itching sensation. In elderlypatients, changes in mental status may be the presenting symptom of a
urinary tract infection. In women with dysuria, asking whether the
discomfort is internal or external is important because vaginal
inflammation can also cause dysuria as urine passes by the inflamed labia.
Abnormally frequent urination (e.g., every hour or two) is termed urinary
frequency. In older adults, urinary frequency often occurs at night and is
termed nocturia. Frequency of normal urination varies considerably from
individual to individual depending on personality traits, bladder capacity,
or drinking habits. It can also be a symptom of a urinary tract infection,
pregnancy in females, or prostate enlargement in males.
Urinary urgency is an abrupt, strong, and often overwhelming need to
urinate. Urgency often causes urinary incontinence, a leakage of urine.
When patients experience urinary urgency, the desire to urinate may be
constant with only a few milliliters of urine eliminated with each5 Read additional information about commonly occurringvoiding.genitourinary system alterations in the âEliminationâ chapter in Open RNNursing Fundamentals.

CHAPTER 12 ABDOMINAL ASSESSMENT 12.3 Gastrointestinal and Genitourinary Assessment,"Objective Assessment Physical examination of the abdomen includes inspection, auscultation,
palpation, and percussion. Note that the order of physical assessment
differs for the abdominal system compared to other systems. Palpation
should occur after the auscultation of bowel sounds so that accurate,
undisturbed bowel sounds can be assessed. The abdomen is roughly
divided into four quadrants: right upper, right lower, left upper, and left
lower (see Figure 12.3
). When assessing the abdomen, consider the
organs located in the quadrant you are examining.
In preparation for the physical assessment, the nurse should create an
environment in which the patient will be comfortable. Encourage the
patient to empty their bladder prior to the assessment. Warm the room
and stethoscope to decrease tensing during assessment.
Inspection
The abdomen is inspected by positioning the patient supine on an
examining table or bed. The head and knees should be supported with
small pillows or folded sheets for comfort and to relax the abdominal wall
musculature. The patientâs arms should be at their side and not folded
behind the head, as this tenses the abdominal wall. Ensure the patient is
covered adequately to maintain privacy, while still exposing the abdomen
as needed for a thorough assessment. Visually examine the abdomen for
overall shape, masses, skin abnormalities, and any abnormal movements.
â¢  Observe the general contour and symmetry of the entire abdominalwall. The contour of the abdomen is often described as flat, rounded,
scaphoid (sunken), or protuberant (convex or bulging).
â¢  Assess for distention. Generalized distention of the abdomen can be
caused by obesity, bowel distention from gas or liquid, or fluid buildup.
â¢  Assess for masses or bulges, which may indicate structural deformities
like hernias or related to disorders in abdominal organs.
â¢  Assess the patientâs skin for uniformity of color, integrity, scarring, or
striae. Striae are white or silvery elongated marks that occur when the
skin stretches, especially during pregnancy or excessive weight gain.
â¢  Note the shape of the umbilicus; it should be inverted and midline.
â¢  Carefully note any scars, and correlate these scars with the patientâs
recollection of previous surgeries or injury.
â¢  Document any abnormal movement or pulsations. Visible intestinal
peristalsis can be caused by intestinal obstruction. Pulsations may be
seen in the epigastric area in patients who are especially thin, but
otherwise should not be observed.
Auscultation
Auscultation, or the listening, of the abdomen, follows inspection for more
accurate assessment of bowel sounds. Use a warmed stethoscope to
assess the frequency and characteristics of the patientâs bowel sounds,
which are also referred to as peristaltic murmurs.
Begin your assessment by gently placing the diaphragm of your
stethoscope on the skin in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), as bowel
sounds are consistently heard in that area. Bowel sounds are generally
high-pitched, gurgling sounds that are heard irregularly. Move your
stethoscope to the next quadrant in a clockwise motion around the
abdominal wall.
It is not recommended to count abdominal sounds because the activity of
normal bowel sounds may cycle with peak-to-peak periods as long as 50
to 60 minutes.
The majority of peristaltic murmurs are produced by the
stomach, with the remainder from the large intestine and a small
contribution from the small intestine. Because the conduction of
peristaltic murmur is heard throughout all parts of the abdomen, the
source of peristaltic murmur is not always at the site where it is heard. If
the conduction of peristaltic sounds is good, auscultation at a single
location is considered adequate.
Hyperactive bowel sounds may indicate bowel obstruction orgastroenteritis. Sometimes you may be able to hear a patientâs bowel
sounds without a stethoscope, often described as âstomach growlingâ or
borborygmus. This is a common example of hyperactive sounds.
Hypoactive bowel sounds may be present with constipation, after
abdominal surgery, peritonitis, or paralytic ileus.  As you auscultate the
abdomen, you should not hear vascular sounds.  If heard, this finding
should be reported to the health care provider.
Palpation
Palpation, or touching, of the abdomen involves using the flat of the hand
and fingers (not the fingertips) to detect palpable organs, abnormal
masses, or tenderness
(see Figure 12.4
). When palpating the abdomen
of a patient reporting abdominal pain, the nurse should palpate that area
last. Light palpation is primarily used by bedside nurses to assess for
musculature, abnormal masses, and tenderness. Deep palpation is a
technique used by advanced practice clinicians to assess for enlarged
organs. Lightly palpate the abdomen by pressing into the skin about 1
centimeter beginning in the RLQ. Continue to move around the abdomen
in a clockwise manner.
Palpate the bladder for distention. Note the patient response to palpation,
such as pain, guarding, rigidity, or rebound tenderness. Guarding refers to
voluntary contraction of the abdominal wall musculature, usually the
result of fear, anxiety, or the touch of cold hands. Rigidity refers to
involuntary contraction of the abdominal musculature in response to
peritoneal inflammation, a reflex the patient cannot control.
Rebound
tenderness is another sign of peritoneal inflammation or peritonitis. To
elicit rebound tenderness, the clinician maintains pressure over an area of
tenderness and then withdraws the hand abruptly. If the patient winces
with pain upon withdrawal of the hand, the test is positive.
Note: If the patient has a Foley catheter in place, additional assessmentsare included in the âFacilitation of Eliminationâ chapter.
Percussion
You may observe advanced practice nurses and other health care
providers percussing the abdomen to obtain additional data. Percussing
can be used to assess the liver and spleen or to determine if costovertebral
angle (CVA) tenderness is present, which is related to inflammation of the
kidney.
â¢  Encourage the patient to empty their
bladder prior to palpation.
â¢  When palpating the abdomen, ask the
patient to bend their knees when lying in a
supine position to enhance relaxation of
abdominal muscles.
See Table 12.3b for a comparison of expected versus unexpected findings
when assessing the abdomen.
Table 12.3b Expected Versus Unexpected Gastrointestinal and
Genitourinary Assessment Findings","CHAPTER 12 ABDOMINAL ASSESSMENT 12.3 Gastrointestinal and Genitourinary Assessment Objective Assessment Physical examination of the abdomen includes inspection, auscultation,
palpation, and percussion. Note that the order of physical assessment
differs for the abdominal system compared to other systems. Palpation
should occur after the auscultation of bowel sounds so that accurate,
undisturbed bowel sounds can be assessed. The abdomen is roughly
divided into four quadrants: right upper, right lower, left upper, and left
lower (see Figure 12.3
). When assessing the abdomen, consider the
organs located in the quadrant you are examining.
In preparation for the physical assessment, the nurse should create an
environment in which the patient will be comfortable. Encourage the
patient to empty their bladder prior to the assessment. Warm the room
and stethoscope to decrease tensing during assessment.
Inspection
The abdomen is inspected by positioning the patient supine on an
examining table or bed. The head and knees should be supported with
small pillows or folded sheets for comfort and to relax the abdominal wall
musculature. The patientâs arms should be at their side and not folded
behind the head, as this tenses the abdominal wall. Ensure the patient is
covered adequately to maintain privacy, while still exposing the abdomen
as needed for a thorough assessment. Visually examine the abdomen for
overall shape, masses, skin abnormalities, and any abnormal movements.
â¢  Observe the general contour and symmetry of the entire abdominalwall. The contour of the abdomen is often described as flat, rounded,
scaphoid (sunken), or protuberant (convex or bulging).
â¢  Assess for distention. Generalized distention of the abdomen can be
caused by obesity, bowel distention from gas or liquid, or fluid buildup.
â¢  Assess for masses or bulges, which may indicate structural deformities
like hernias or related to disorders in abdominal organs.
â¢  Assess the patientâs skin for uniformity of color, integrity, scarring, or
striae. Striae are white or silvery elongated marks that occur when the
skin stretches, especially during pregnancy or excessive weight gain.
â¢  Note the shape of the umbilicus; it should be inverted and midline.

supporting structure of the body. See Figure 13.1
for an illustration of the
major bones in the body. The bones of the lower limbs are adapted for
weight-bearing support, stability, and walking. The upper limbs are highly
mobile with large range of movements, along with the ability to easily
manipulate objects with our hands and opposable thumbs.
Bones are connected together by ligaments. Ligaments are strong bands
of fibrous connective tissue that strengthen and support the joint by
anchoring the bones together and preventing their separation. Ligamentsallow for normal movements of a joint while also limiting the range of
these motions to prevent excessive or abnormal joint movements.","CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts Skeleton The skeleton is composed of 206 bones that provide the internal

CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,"Muscles There are three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle,
and smooth muscle. Skeletal muscle produces movement, assists in
maintaining posture, protects internal organs, and generates body heat.
Skeletal muscles are voluntary, meaning a person is able to consciously
control them, but they also depend on signals from the nervous system to
work properly. Other types of muscles are involuntary and are controlled
by the autonomic nervous system, such as the smooth muscle within our
bronchioles.
See Figure 13.2
for an illustration of skeletal muscle.
To move the skeleton, the tension created by the contraction of the
skeletal muscles is transferred to the tendons, strong bands of dense,
regular connective tissue that connect muscles to bones.
MUSCLE ATROPHYMuscle atrophy is the thinning or loss of muscle tissue. See Figure 13.3
for
an image of muscle atrophy. There are three types of muscle atrophy:
physiologic, pathologic, and neurogenic.
Physiologic atrophy is caused by not using the muscles and can often be
reversed with exercise and improved nutrition. People who are most
affected by physiologic atrophy are those who:
â¢  Have seated jobs, health problems that limit movement, or decreased
activity levels
â¢  Are bedridden
â¢  Cannot move their limbs because of stroke or other brain disease
â¢  Are in a place that lacks gravity, such as during space flights
Pathologic atrophy is seen with aging, starvation, and adverse effects of
long-term use of corticosteroids. Neurogenic atrophy is the most severe
type of muscle atrophy. It can be from an injured or diseased nerve that
connects to the muscle. Examples of neurogenic atrophy are spinal cord
injuries and polio.
Although physiologic atrophy due to disuse can often be reversed with
related atrophy are especially pronounced in people who are sedentary
because the loss of muscle results in functional impairments such as
trouble with walking, balance, and posture. These functional impairments
can cause decreased quality of life and injuries due to falls.","CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts Muscles There are three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle,

CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.2 Musculoskeletal Basic Concepts,"Joints Joints are the location where bones come together. Many joints allow for
movement between the bones. Synovial joints are the most common
type of joint in the body. Synovial joints have a fluid-filled joint cavity
where the articulating surfaces of the bones contact and move smoothly
against each other. See Figure 13.4
for an illustration of a synovial joint.
where they come together and allows the bones to glide over each other
with very little friction. Articular cartilage can be damaged by injury or
normal wear and tear. Lining the inner surface of the articular capsule is a
thin synovial membrane. The cells of this membrane secrete synovial
fluid, a thick, slimy fluid that provides lubrication to further reduce friction
between the bones of the joint.
Types of Synovial Joints
There are six types of synovial joints. See Figure 13.5
for an illustration of
the types of synovial joints. Some joints are relatively immobile but stable.
Other joints have more freedom of movement but are at greater risk of
injury. For example, the hinge joint of the knee allows flexion and
extension, whereas the ball and socket joint of the hip and shoulder allows
flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and rotation. The knee, hip, and
shoulder joints are commonly injured and are discussed in more detail in
the following subsections.
SHOULDER JOINTThe shoulder joint is a ball-and-socket joint formed by the articulation
between the head of the humerus and the glenoid cavity of the scapula.
This joint has the largest range of motion of any joint in the body. See
Figure 13.6
to review the anatomy of the shoulder joint. Injuries to the
shoulder joint are common, especially during repetitive abductive use of
the upper limb such as during throwing, swimming, or racquet sports.
HIP JOINTThe hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint between the head of the femur and
the acetabulum of the hip bone. The hip carries the weight of the body
and thus requires strength and stability during standing and walking.
See Figure 13.7
A common hip injury in older adults, often referred to as a âbroken hip,â is
actually a fracture of the head of the femur. Hip fractures are commonly
caused by falls.
See more information about hip fractures under the âCommonMusculoskeletal Conditionsâ section.
KNEE JOINTThe knee functions as a hinge joint that allows flexion and extension of the
leg. In addition, some rotation of the leg is available when the knee is
flexed, but not when extended. See Figure 13.8
for an illustration of the
knee joint. The knee is vulnerable to injuries associated with
hyperextension, twisting, or blows to the medial or lateral side of the joint,
particularly while weight bearing.
the extended position. On the outside of the knee joint are the lateral
collateral, medial collateral, and tibial collateral ligaments. The lateral
collateral ligament is on the lateral side of the knee and spans from the
lateral side of the femur to the head of the fibula. The medial collateral
ligament runs from the medial side of the femur to the medial tibia. The
tibial collateral ligament crosses the knee and is attached to the articular
capsule and to the medial meniscus. In the fully extended knee position,
both collateral ligaments are taut and stabilize the knee by preventing
side-to-side or rotational motions between the femur and tibia.
Inside the knee joint are the anterior cruciate ligament and posterior
cruciate ligament. These ligaments are anchored inferiorly to the tibia and
run diagonally upward to attach to the inner aspect of a femoral condyle.
The posterior cruciate ligament supports the knee when it is flexed and
weight-bearing such as when walking downhill. The anterior cruciate
ligament becomes tight when the knee is extended and resists
hyperextension.
The patella is a bone incorporated into the tendon of the quadriceps
muscle, the large muscle of the anterior thigh. The patella protects the
quadriceps tendon from friction against the distal femur. Continuing from
the patella to the anterior tibia just below the knee is the patellar
ligament. Acting via the patella and patellar ligament, the quadriceps is a
powerful muscle that extends the leg at the knee and provides support
and stabilization for the knee joint.
Located between the articulating surfaces of the femur and tibia are two
articular discs, the medial meniscus and lateral meniscus. Each meniscus
is a C-shaped fibrocartilage that provides padding between the bones.
Joint Movements
Several movements may be performed by synovial joints. Abduction is the
movement away from the midline of the body. Adduction is the
movement toward the middle line of the body. Extension is the
straightening of limbs (increase in angle) at a joint. Flexion is bending the
limbs (reduction of angle) at a joint. Rotation is a circular movement
around a fixed point. See Figures 13.9
and 13.10
for images of the types
of movements of different joints in the body.
Joint Sounds
Sounds that occur as joints are moving are often referred to as crepitus.
There are many different types of sounds that can occur as a joint moves,
and patients may describe these sounds as popping, snapping, catching,clicking, crunching, cracking, crackling, creaking, grinding, grating, and
clunking. There are several potential causes of these noises such as
bursting of tiny bubbles in the synovial fluid, snapping of ligaments, or a
disease condition. While assessing joints, be aware that joint noises are
common during activity and are usually painless and harmless, but if they
are associated with an injury or are accompanied by pain or swelling, they
should be reported to the health care provider for follow-up.

Several movements may be performed by synovial joints. Abduction is the
movement away from the midline of the body. Adduction is the
movement toward the middle line of the body. Extension is the
straightening of limbs (increase in angle) at a joint. Flexion is bending the
limbs (reduction of angle) at a joint. Rotation is a circular movement
around a fixed point. See Figures 13.9
and 13.10
for images of the types
of movements of different joints in the body.
Joint Sounds
Sounds that occur as joints are moving are often referred to as crepitus.
There are many different types of sounds that can occur as a joint moves,
and patients may describe these sounds as popping, snapping, catching,clicking, crunching, cracking, crackling, creaking, grinding, grating, and
clunking. There are several potential causes of these noises such as
bursting of tiny bubbles in the synovial fluid, snapping of ligaments, or a
disease condition. While assessing joints, be aware that joint noises are
common during activity and are usually painless and harmless, but if they
are associated with an injury or are accompanied by pain or swelling, they
should be reported to the health care provider for follow-up.

CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.3 Common Musculoskeletal Conditions,"Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is a disease that thins and weakens bones, causing them to
become fragile and break easily. See Figure 13.11
for an illustration
comparing the top right image of normal bone to the bottom right image
of bone with osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is common in older women and
often occurs in the hip, spine, and wrist. To keep bones strong, patients at
risk are educated to eat a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, participate in
weight-bearing exercise, and avoid smoking. If needed, medications such
as bisphosphonates and calcitonin are used to treat severe osteoporosis.","CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.3 Common Musculoskeletal Conditions Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is a disease that thins and weakens bones, causing them to

CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.3 Common Musculoskeletal Conditions,"Fracture A fracture is the medical term for a broken bone. There are many different
types of fractures commonly caused by sports injuries, falls, and car
accidents. Additionally, people with osteoporosis are at higher risk for
fractures from minor injuries due to weakening of the bones. See Figure
for an illustration of different types of fractures. For example, if the13.12
broken bone punctures the skin, it is called an open fracture. Symptoms
â¢  Intense pain
â¢  Deformity (i.e., the limb looks out of place)
â¢  Swelling, bruising, or tenderness around the injury
â¢  Numbness and tingling of the extremity distal to the injury
â¢  Difficulty moving a limb
A suspected fracture requires immediate medical attention and an X-ray
to determine if the bone is broken. Treatment includes a cast or splint. In
severe fractures, surgery is performed to place plates, pins, or screws in
the bones to keep them in place as they heal.
Hip Fracture
A hip fracture, commonly referred to as a âbroken hip,â is actually a
fracture of the femoral neck. See Figure 13.13
for an image of a hip
fracture. Hip fractures are typically caused by a fall, especially in older
adults with preexisting osteoporosis. Symptoms of a hip fracture after a
fall include the following:
â¢  Pain
â¢  An inability to lift, move, or rotate the affected leg
â¢  An inability to stand or put weight on the affected leg
â¢  Bruising and swelling around the hip
â¢  The injured leg appears shorter than the other leg
â¢  The injured leg is rotated outwards
Hip fractures typically require surgical repair within 48 hours of the injury.
In approximately half of the cases of hip fractures, hip replacement is
needed. See more information about hip replacement under the
âOsteoarthritisâ section below. In other cases, the fracture is fixed with
surgery called Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF) where the surgeon
makes an incision to realign the bones, and then they are internally fixated
(i.e., held together) with hardware like metal pins, plates, rods, or screws.
After the bone heals, this hardware isnât removed unless additional
symptoms occur. After surgery, the patient will need mobility assistance
for a prolonged period of time from family members or in a long-term
care facility, and the reduced mobility can result in additional falls if
also associated with life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia,
infected pressure injuries, and blood clots that can move to the lungs
causing pulmonary embolism.","CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.3 Common Musculoskeletal Conditions Fracture A fracture is the medical term for a broken bone. There are many different

CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.3 Common Musculoskeletal Conditions,"Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis associated with
aging and wear and tear of the articular cartilage that covers the surfaces
of bones at a synovial joint. OA causes the cartilage to gradually become
thinner, and as the cartilage layer wears down, more pressure is placed on
the bones. The joint responds by increasing production of the synovial
fluid for more lubrication, but this can cause swelling of the joint cavity.
The bone tissue underlying the damaged articular cartilage also responds
rough or bumpy. As a result, joint movement results in pain and
inflammation. In early stages of OA, symptoms may be resolved with mild
activity that warms up the joint. However, in advanced OA, the affected
joints become more painful and difficult to use, resulting in decreased
mobility. There is no cure for osteoarthritis, but several treatments can
help alleviate the pain. Treatments may include weight loss, low-impact
exercise, and medications such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and celecoxib. For severe cases of OA, joint
replacement surgery may be required.

CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.3 Common Musculoskeletal Conditions,"Joint Replacement Arthroplasty, the medical term for joint replacement surgery, is an
invasive procedure requiring extended recovery time, so conservative
treatments such as lifestyle changes and medications are attempted
before surgery is performed. See Figure 13.15
for an illustration of joint
replacement surgery. This type of surgery involves replacing the articular
surfaces of the bones with prosthesis (artificial components). For example,
in hip arthroplasty, the worn or damaged parts of the hip joint, including
the head and neck of the femur and the acetabulum of the pelvis, are
removed and replaced with artificial joint components. The replacement
head for the femur consists of a rounded ball attached to the end of a
shaft that is inserted inside the femur. The acetabulum of the pelvis is
reshaped and a replacement socket is fitted into its place.
Hip Replacement
Hip replacement is surgery for people with severe hip damage often
caused by osteoarthritis or a hip fracture. During a hip replacement
operation, the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from the
hip joint and replaces them with artificial parts.
The most common complication after surgery is hip dislocation. Because a
man-made hip is smaller than the original joint, the ball may easily come
out of its socket. Some general rules of thumb when caring for patients
during the recovery period are as follows:
â¢  Patients should not cross their legs or ankles when they are sitting,
standing, or lying down.
â¢  Patients should not lean too far forward from their waist or pull their
leg up past their waist. This bending is called hip flexion. Avoid hip
flexion greater than 90 degrees.","CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.3 Common Musculoskeletal Conditions Joint Replacement Arthroplasty, the medical term for joint replacement surgery, is an

CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.3 Common Musculoskeletal Conditions,"Vertebral Disorders The spine is composed of many vertebrae stacked on top of one another,
in the vertebral column causing curvature of the spine such as kyphosis,
lordosis, and scoliosis. See Figure 13.18
for an illustration of kyphosis,
lordosis, and scoliosis.
Kyphosis is a curving of the spine that causes a bowing or rounding of the
back, often referred to as a âbuffalo humpâ that can lead to a hunchback or
slouching posture. Kyphosis can be caused by osteoarthritis, osteoporosis,
or other conditions. Pain in the middle or lower back is the most common
symptom. Treatment depends upon the cause, the severity of pain, and
the presence of any neurological symptoms.
Lordosis is the inward curve of the lumbar spine just above the buttocks. A
small degree of lordosis is normal, especially during the third trimester of
pregnancy. Too much curving of the lower back is often called swayback.
Most of the time, lordosis is not treated if the back is flexible because it is
not likely to progress or cause problems.
Scoliosis causes a sideways curve of the spine. It commonly develops in
late childhood and the early teens when children grow quickly. Symptoms
of scoliosis include leaning to one side and having uneven shoulders and
hips. Treatment depends on the patientâs age, the amount of expected
additional growth, the degree of curving, and whether the curve is
temporary or permanent. Patients with mild scoliosis might only need
checkups to monitor if the curve is getting worse, whereas others may
require a brace or have surgery.","CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.3 Common Musculoskeletal Conditions Vertebral Disorders The spine is composed of many vertebrae stacked on top of one another,

patients to wear protective gear during sports may help to prevent future
dislocations.
ClubfootClubfoot is a congenital condition that causes the foot and lower leg to
turn inward and downward. A congenital condition means it is present at
birth. See Figure 13.20
for an image of an infant with a clubfoot. It can
range from mild and flexible to severe and rigid. Treatment by an

CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.3 Common Musculoskeletal Conditions,"Sprains and Strains A sprain is a stretched or torn ligament caused by an injury. Ligaments are
tissues that attach bones at a joint. Ankle and wrist sprains are very
common, especially due to falls or participation in sports. See Figure 13.21
for an illustration of an ankle sprain caused by eversion or inversion of the
ankle. Symptoms include pain, swelling, bruising, and the inability to move
the joint. The patient may also report feeling a pop when the injury
occurred.
A strain is a stretched or torn muscle or tendon. Tendons are tissues that
connect muscle to bone. See Figure 13.22
for an image of a strained
tendon. Strains can happen suddenly from an injury or develop over time
due to chronic overuse. Symptoms include pain, muscle spasms, swelling,
and trouble moving the muscle.
Treatment of sprains and strains is often referred to with the mnemonic
RICE that stands for Resting the injured area, Icing the area, Compressing
the area with an ACE bandage or other device, and Elevating the affected
limb. Medications such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be used.
KNEE INJURIES AND ARTHROSCOPIC SURGERYKnee injuries are common. Because the knee joint is primarily supported
by muscles and ligaments, injuries to any of these structures will result in
pain or knee instability. Arthroscopic surgery has greatly improved the
surgical treatment of knee injuries and reduced subsequent recovery
times. This procedure involves a small incision and the insertion of an
arthroscope, a pencil-thin instrument that allows for visualization of the
joint interior. Small surgical instruments are inserted via additional

CHAPTER 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL ASSESSMENT 13.4 Musculoskeletal Assessment,"Objective Assessment The purpose of a routine physical exam of the musculoskeletal system by
a registered nurse is to assess function and to screen for abnormalities.
Most information about function and mobility is gathered during the
patient interview, but the nurse also observes the patientâs posture,
walking, and movement of their extremities during the physical exam.
During a routine assessment of a patient during inpatient care, a
registered nurse typically completes the following musculoskeletal
assessments:
â¢  Assess gait
â¢  Inspect the spine
â¢  Observe range of motion of joints
â¢  Inspect muscles and extremities for size and symmetry
â¢  Assess muscle strength
â¢  Palpate extremities for tenderness
While assessing an older adult, keep in mind they may have limited
mobility and range of motion due to age-related degeneration of joints
and muscle weakness. Be considerate of these limitations and never
examine any areas to the point of pain or discomfort. Support the joints
and muscles as you assess them to avoid pain or muscle spasm. Compare
bilateral sides simultaneously and expect symmetry of structure and
function of the corresponding body area.
Inspection
General inspection begins by observing the patient in the standing
position for postural abnormalities. Observe their stance and note any
abnormal curvature of the spine such as kyphosis, lordosis, or scoliosis. Ask
the patient to walk away from you, turn, and walk back toward you while
observing their gait and balance.
Ask the patient to sit. Inspect the size and contour of the muscles and
joints and if the corresponding parts are symmetrical. Notice the skin over
the joints and muscles and observe if there is tenderness, swelling,
erythema, deformity, or asymmetry. Observe how the patient moves their
extremities and note if there is pain with movement or any limitations in
active range of motion (ROM). Active range of motion is the degree ofmovement the patient can voluntarily achieve in a joint without
assistance. See Figures 13.9 and 13.10 as resources for describing joint
movement.
Palpation
Palpation is typically done simultaneously during inspection. As you
observe, palpate each joint for warmth, swelling, or tenderness. If you
observe decreased active range of motion, gently attempt passive range
of motion by stabilizing the joint with one hand while using the other
hand to gently move the joint to its limit of movement. Passive range of
motion is the degree of range of motion demonstrated in a joint when the
examiner is providing the movement. You may hear crepitus as the joint
moves. Crepitus sounds like a crackling, popping noise that is considered
normal as long as it is not associated with pain. As the joint moves, there
should not be any reported pain or tenderness.
Assess muscle strength. Muscle strength should be equal bilaterally, and
the patient should be able to fully resist an opposing force. Muscle
strength varies among people depending on their activity level, genetic
predisposition, lifestyle, and history.  A common method of evaluating
muscle strength is the Medical Research Council Manual Muscle Testing
Scale.
This method involves testing key muscles from the upper and
lower extremities against gravity and the examinerâs resistance and
grading the patientâs strength on a 0 to 5 scale. See Box 13.4 for the muscle
strength testing scale.
Box 13.4 Muscle Strength Scale
0 â No muscle contraction
1 â Trace muscle contraction, such as a twitch
2 â Active movement only when gravity eliminated
3 â Active movement against gravity but not against
resistance
4 â Active movement against gravity and some resistance
5 â Active movement against gravity and examinerâs full
resistance
To assess upper extremity strength, first begin by assessing bilateral hand
grip strength. Extend your index and second fingers on each hand toward
the patient and ask them to squeeze them as tightly as possible. Then, ask
the patient to extend their arms with their palms up. As you provide
resistance on their forearms, ask the patient to pull their arms towards
them. Finally, ask the patient to place their palms against yours and press
while you provide resistance. See Figure 13.25
for images of a nurse
assessing upper extremity strength.
To assess lower extremity strength, perform the following maneuvers with
a seated patient. Place your palms on the patientâs thighs and ask them to
lift their legs while providing resistance. Secondly, place your hands
behind their calves and ask them to pull their legs backwards while you
provide resistance. Place your hands on the top of their feet and ask them
to pull their feet upwards against your resistance. Finally, place your hands
on the soles of their feet and ask them to press downwards while you
provide resistance, instructing them to âpress downwards like pressing the
for images of a nurse assessing lowergas pedal on a car.â See Figure 13.26

CHAPTER 14 INTEGUMENTARY ASSESSMENT 14.2 Basic Integumentary Concepts,"Skin The skin is made of multiple layers of cells and tissues, which are held to
underlying structures by connective tissue. See Figure 14.1
for an image of
the layers of the skin. The skin is composed of two main layers: the
uppermost thin layer called the epidermis made of closely packed
epithelial cells, and the inner thick layer called the dermis that houses
blood vessels, hair follicles, sweat glands, and nerve fibers. Beneath the
dermis lies the hypodermis that contains connective tissue and adipose
tissue (stored fat) to connect the skin to the underlying bones and
muscles. The skin acts as a sense organ because the epidermis, dermis,
and hypodermis contain specialized sensory nerve structures that detect
touch, surface temperature, and pain.
The color of skin is created by pigments, including melanin, carotene, and
hemoglobin. Melanin is produced by cells called melanocytes that are
for an illustration ofscattered throughout the epidermis. See Figure 14.2
melanin and melanocytes. When there is an irregular accumulation of
melanocytes in the skin, freckles appear. Dark-skinned individuals
produce more melanin than those with pale skin. Exposure to the UV rays
of the sun or a tanning bed causes additional melanin to be
manufactured and built up, resulting in the darkening of the skin referred
to as a tan. Increased melanin accumulation protects the DNA ofepidermal cells from UV ray damage, but it requires about ten days after
initial sun exposure for melanin synthesis to peak. This is why pale-skinned
individuals often suffer sunburns during initial exposure to the sun.
Darker-skinned individuals can also get sunburns, but they are more
protected from their existing melanin than pale-skinned individuals.
Too much sun exposure can eventually lead to wrinkling due to the
destruction of the cellular structure of the skin, and in severe cases, can
cause DNA damage resulting in skin cancer. Moles are larger masses of
melanocytes, and although most are benign, they should be monitored
for changes that indicate the presence of skin cancer. See Figure 14.3
for
an image of moles.
Patients are encouraged to use the ABCDE mnemonic to watch for signs
of early-stage melanoma developing in moles. Consult a health care
provider if you find these signs of melanoma when assessing a patientâs
skin:
â¢  Asymmetrical: The sides of the moles are not symmetrical
â¢  Color: The color of the mole has various shades of brown or black
â¢  Diameter: The mole  is larger than 6 mm. (0.24 in.)

CHAPTER 14 INTEGUMENTARY ASSESSMENT 14.2 Basic Integumentary Concepts,"Hair Hair is made of dead, keratinized cells that originate in the hair follicle in
the dermis. For these reasons, there is no sensation in hair. See Figure 14.4
for an image of a hair follicle. Hair serves a variety of functions, including
protection, sensory input, thermoregulation, and communication. For
example, hair on the head protects the skull from the sun. Hair in the
nose, ears, and around the eyes (eyelashes) defends the body by trapping
any dust particles that may contain allergens and microbes. Hair of the
eyebrows prevents sweat and other particles from dripping into the eyes.
Hair also has a sensory function due to sensory innervation by a hair root
plexus surrounding the base of each hair follicle. Hair is extremely sensitive
to air movement or other disturbances in the environment, even more so
than the skin surface. This feature is also useful for the detection of the
presence of insects or other potentially damaging substances on the skin
surface. Each hair root is also connected to a smooth muscle called the
arrector pili that contracts in response to nerve signals from the
sympathetic nervous system, making the external hair shaft âstand up.â
This movement is commonly referred to as goose bumps. The primary
purpose for this movement is to trap a layer of air to add insulation.","CHAPTER 14 INTEGUMENTARY ASSESSMENT 14.2 Basic Integumentary Concepts Hair Hair is made of dead, keratinized cells that originate in the hair follicle in

CHAPTER 14 INTEGUMENTARY ASSESSMENT 14.2 Basic Integumentary Concepts,"Sweat Glands When the body becomes warm, sweat glands produce sweat to cool the
body. There are two types of sweat glands that secrete slightly different
products. An eccrine sweat gland  produces hypotonic sweat for
thermoregulation. See Figure 14.6
for an illustration of an eccrine sweat
gland. These glands are found all over the skinâs surface, but are especially
abundant on the palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and the
forehead. They are coiled glands lying deep in the dermis, with the duct
rising up to a pore on the skin surface where the sweat is released. This
type of sweat is composed mostly of water and some salt, antibodies,
traces of metabolic waste, and dermicidin, an antimicrobial peptide.
Eccrine glands are a primary component of thermoregulation and help to
maintain homeostasis.
Apocrine sweat glands are mostly found in hair follicles in densely hairy
areas, such as the armpits and genital regions. In addition to secreting
water and salt, apocrine sweat includes organic compounds that make
the sweat thicker and subject to bacterial decomposition and subsequent
odor. The release of this sweat is controlled by the nervous system andhormones and plays a role in the human pheromone response. Most
commercial antiperspirants use an aluminum-based compound as their
primary active ingredient to stop sweat. When the antiperspirant enters
the sweat gland duct, the aluminum-based compounds form a physical
block in the duct, which prevents sweat from coming out of the pore.","CHAPTER 14 INTEGUMENTARY ASSESSMENT 14.2 Basic Integumentary Concepts Sweat Glands When the body becomes warm, sweat glands produce sweat to cool the

odor. The release of this sweat is controlled by the nervous system andhormones and plays a role in the human pheromone response. Most
commercial antiperspirants use an aluminum-based compound as their
primary active ingredient to stop sweat. When the antiperspirant enters
the sweat gland duct, the aluminum-based compounds form a physical
block in the duct, which prevents sweat from coming out of the pore.",374

the size of a sesame seed, but the eggs, called nits, are smaller and can
appear like a dandruff flake. See Figure 14.9
for an image of very small
white nits in a personâs hair. Children ages 3-11 often get head lice at school

CHAPTER 14 INTEGUMENTARY ASSESSMENT 14.3 Common Integumentary Conditions,"Burns A burn results when the skin is damaged by intense heat, radiation,
electricity, or chemicals. The damage results in the death of skin cells,
which can lead to a massive loss of fluid due to loss of the skinâs protection.
Burned skin is also extremely susceptible to infection due to the loss of
protection by intact layers of skin.
Burns are classified by the degree of their severity. A first-degree burn,
the skin may be painful and swollen, these burns typically heal on their
own within a few days. Mild sunburn fits into the category of a first-degree
burn. A second-degree burn, also referred to as a partial thickness
burn, affects both the epidermis and a portion of the dermis. These burns
result in swelling and a painful blistering of the skin. It is important to keep
the burn site clean to prevent infection. With good care, a second degree
burn will heal within several weeks. A third-degree burn, also referred to as
a full thickness burn, extends fully into the epidermis and dermis,
destroying the tissue and affecting the nerve endings and sensory
function. These are serious burns that require immediate medical
attention. A fourth-degree burn, also referred to as a deep full thickness
burn, is even more severe, affecting the underlying muscle and bone.
Third- and fourth-degree burns are usually not as painful as second
degree burns because the nerve endings are damaged. Full thickness
burns require debridement (removal of dead skin) followed by grafting of
the skin from an unaffected part of the body or from skin grown in tissue
culture.

CHAPTER 14 INTEGUMENTARY ASSESSMENT 14.4 Integumentary Assessment,"Objective Assessment There are five key areas to note during a focused integumentary
assessment: color, skin temperature, moisture level, skin turgor, and any
lesions or skin breakdown. Certain body areas require particular
observation because they are more prone to pressure injuries, such as
bony prominences, skin folds, perineum, between digits of the hands and
feet, and under any medical device that can be removed during routine
daily care.
Inspection
COLORInspect the color of the patientâs skin and compare findings to what is
expected for their skin tone. Note a change in color such as pallor
(paleness), cyanosis (blueness), jaundice (yellowness), or erythema
(redness). Note if there is any bruising (ecchymosis) present.
SCALPIf the patient reports itching of the scalp, inspect the scalp for lice and/or
nits.
LESIONS AND SKIN BREAKDOWNNote any lesions, skin breakdown, or unusual findings, such as rashes,
petechiae, unusual moles, or burns. Be aware that unusual patterns of
bruising or burns can be signs of abuse that warrant further investigation
and reporting according to agency policy and state regulations.
Auscultation
Auscultation does not occur during a focused integumentary exam.
Palpation
Palpation of the skin includes assessing temperature, moisture, texture,
is helpful to apply pressure with a gloved finger to further assess for
blanching (whitening with pressure).
TEMPERATURE, MOISTURE, AND TEXTUREFever, decreased perfusion of the extremities, and local inflammation in
tissues can cause changes in skin temperature. For example, a fever can
cause a patientâs skin to feel warm and sweaty (diaphoretic). Decreased
perfusion of the extremities can cause the patientâs hands and feet to feel
cool, whereas local tissue infection or inflammation can make the
localized area feel warmer than the surrounding skin. Research has shown
that experienced practitioners can palpate skin temperature accurately
and detect differences as small as 1 to 2 degrees Celsius. For accurate
palpation of skin temperature, do not hold anything warm or cold in your
hands for several minutes prior to palpation. Use the palmar surface of
your dominant hand to assess temperature.
While assessing skin
temperature, also assess if the skin feels dry or moist and the texture of
the skin. Skin that appears or feels sweaty is referred to as being
diaphoretic.
CAPILLARY REFILLThe capillary refill test is a test done on the nail beds to monitor perfusion,
the amount of blood flow to tissue. Pressure is applied to a fingernail or
toenail until it turns white, indicating that the blood has been forced from
the tissue under the nail. This whiteness is called blanching. Once the
tissue has blanched, remove pressure. Capillary refill is defined as the time
it takes for color to return to the tissue after pressure has been removed
that caused blanching. If there is sufficient blood flow to the area, a pink
color should return within 2 seconds after the pressure is removed.
Cardiovascular Assessment Part Two | Capillary Refill
SKIN TURGORSkin turgor may be included when assessing a patientâs hydration status,
but research has shown it is not a good indicator. Skin turgor is the skinâs
elasticity. Its ability to change shape and return to normal may be
decreased when the patient is dehydrated. To check for skin turgor, gently
grasp skin on the patientâs lower arm between two fingers so that it is
tented upwards, and then release. Skin with normal turgor snaps rapidly
back to its normal position, but skin with poor turgor takes additional time
to return to its normal position.
Skin turgor is not a reliable method to
assess for dehydration in older adults because they have decreased skin
elasticity, so other assessments for dehydration should be included.
EDEMAIf edema is present on inspection, palpate the area to determine if the
edema is pitting or nonpitting. Press on the skin to assess for indentation,
ideally over a bony structure, such as the tibia. If no indentation occurs, it is
referred to as nonpitting edema. If indentation occurs, it is referred to as
pitting edema. See Figure 14.22
for an image demonstrating pitting
edema. If pitting edema is present, document the depth of the indention
and how long it takes for the skin to rebound back to its original position.
The indentation and time required to rebound to the original position are
graded on a scale from 1 to 4, where 1+ indicates a barely detectable
depression with immediate rebound, and 4+ indicates a deep depressionwith a time lapse of over 20 seconds required to rebound. See Figure
14.23
for an illustration of grading edema.","CHAPTER 14 INTEGUMENTARY ASSESSMENT 14.4 Integumentary Assessment Objective Assessment There are five key areas to note during a focused integumentary

but research has shown it is not a good indicator. Skin turgor is the skinâs
elasticity. Its ability to change shape and return to normal may be
decreased when the patient is dehydrated. To check for skin turgor, gently
grasp skin on the patientâs lower arm between two fingers so that it is
tented upwards, and then release. Skin with normal turgor snaps rapidly
back to its normal position, but skin with poor turgor takes additional time
to return to its normal position.
Skin turgor is not a reliable method to
assess for dehydration in older adults because they have decreased skin
elasticity, so other assessments for dehydration should be included.
EDEMAIf edema is present on inspection, palpate the area to determine if the
edema is pitting or nonpitting. Press on the skin to assess for indentation,
ideally over a bony structure, such as the tibia. If no indentation occurs, it is
referred to as nonpitting edema. If indentation occurs, it is referred to as
pitting edema. See Figure 14.22
for an image demonstrating pitting
edema. If pitting edema is present, document the depth of the indention
and how long it takes for the skin to rebound back to its original position.
The indentation and time required to rebound to the original position are
graded on a scale from 1 to 4, where 1+ indicates a barely detectable
depression with immediate rebound, and 4+ indicates a deep depressionwith a time lapse of over 20 seconds required to rebound. See Figure
14.23
for an illustration of grading edema.",1146
CHAPTER 14 INTEGUMENTARY ASSESSMENT 14.4 Integumentary Assessment,"Life Span Considerations Older Adults
Older adults have several changes associated with aging that are
apparent during assessment of the integumentary system. They often
have cardiac and circulatory system conditions that cause decreased
perfusion, resulting in cool hands and feet. They have decreased elasticity
and fragile skin that often tears more easily. The blood vessels of the
dermis become more fragile, leading to bruising and bleeding under the
skin. The subcutaneous fat layer thins, so it has less insulation and
padding and reduced ability to maintain body temperature. Growths such
as skin tags, rough patches (keratoses), skin cancers, and other lesions are
more common. Older adults may also be less able to sense touch,
pressure, vibration, heat, and cold.
When completing an integumentary assessment it is important to
distinguish between expected and unexpected assessment findings.
Please review Table 14.4b to review common expected and unexpected
integumentary findings.

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,"Types of Orders Prescriptions are often referred to as orders in clinical practice. There are
several types of orders, such as routine orders, PRN orders, standing
orders, one-time orders, STAT orders, and titration orders.
â¢  A routine order is a prescription that is followed until another order
cancels it. An example of a routine order is âLisinopril 10 mg PO daily.â
â¢  A PRN (or as-needed) order is a prescription for medication to be
PRN orders are typically administered based on patient symptoms,
such as pain, nausea, or itching. An example of a PRN order for pain
medication is âAcetaminophen 500 mg PO every 4-6 hours as needed
for pain.â
â¢  A standing order is also referred to in practice as an âorder setâ or a
âprotocol.â Standing orders are standardized prescriptions for nurses
to implement to any patient in clearly defined circumstances without
the need to initially notify a provider. An example of a standing order
set/protocol for patients visiting an urgent care clinic reporting chest
pain is to immediately administer four chewable aspirin, establish
intravenous (IV) access, and obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG).
â¢  A one-time order is a prescription for a medication to be administered
only once. An example of a one-time order is a prescription for an IV
dose of antibiotics to be administered immediately prior to surgery.
â¢  A STAT order is a one-time order that is administered without delay
due to the urgency of the circumstances. An example of a STAT order
is âBenadryl 50 mg PO statâ for a patient having an allergic reaction.
â¢  A titration order is an order in which the medication dose is either
progressively increased or decreased by the nurse in response to the
patientâs status. Titration orders are typically used for patients in
critical care as defined by agency policy. The Joint Commission
requires titration orders to include the medication name, medication
route, initial rate of infusion (dose/unit of time), incremental units to
which the rate or dose can be increased or decreased, how often the
rate or dose can be changed, the maximum rate or dose of infusion,
and the objective clinical measure to be used to guide changes. An
example of a titration order is âNorepinephrine 2-12 micrograms/min,
start at 2 mcg/min and titrate upward by 1 mcg/min every 5 minutes

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,"Components of a Medication Order According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, all orders for
the administration of drugs and biologicals must contain the following
information:
â¢  Name of the patient
â¢  Age or date of birth
â¢  Date and time of the order
â¢  Drug name
â¢  Dose, frequency, and route
â¢  Name/Signature of the prescriber
â¢  Weight of the patient to facilitate dose calculation when applicable.
(Note that dose calculations are based on metric weight: kilograms for
children/adults or grams for newborns)
â¢  Dose calculation requirements, when applicable
â¢  Exact strength or concentration, when applicable
â¢  Quantity and/or duration of the prescription, when applicable
â¢  Specific instructions for use, when applicable
When reviewing a medication order, the nurse must ensure these
components are included in the prescription before administering the
medication. If a pertinent piece of information is not included, the nurse
must contact the prescribing provider to clarify and correct the order.
Drug Name
The name of the drug may be ordered by the generic name or brand
name. The generic name is considered the safest method to use and
Dose
The dosage of a drug is prescribed using either the metric or the
household system. The metric system is the most commonly accepted
system internationally. Examples of standard dosage are 5 mL (milliliters)
or 1 teaspoon. Standard abbreviations of metric measurement are
frequently used regarding the dosage, such as mg (milligram), kg
(kilogram), mL (milliliter), mcg (microgram), or L (liter). However, it is
considered safe practice to avoid other abbreviations and include the full
words in prescriptions to avoid errors. In fact, several abbreviations have
been deemed unsafe by the Joint Commission and have been put on a
âdo not useâ list. See the hyperlinks below to view the Joint Commission
âDo Not Use Listâ and the Institute of Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) list
of abbreviations to avoid. If a dosage is unclear or written in a confusing
manner in a prescription, it is always best to clarify the order with the
prescribing provider before administering the medication.
Frequency
Frequency in prescriptions is indicated by how many times a day the
medication is to be administered or how often it is to be administered in
hours or minutes. Examples of frequency include verbiage such as once
daily, twice daily, three times daily, four times daily, every 30 minutes, every
hour, every four hours, or every eight hours. Medication times are typically
indicated using military time (i.e., using a 24-hour clock). For example, 11p.m. is indicated as â2300.â Read more about military time in the âMathCalculationsâ chapter.
Some types of medications may be ordered âaround the clock (ATC).â An
around-the-clock frequency order indicates they should be administered
at regular time intervals, such as every six hours, to maintain consistent
levels of the drug in the patientâs bloodstream. For example, pain
medications administered at end of life are often prescribed ATC instead
of PRN (as needed) to maintain optimal pain relief.
Route of Administration
Common routes of administration and standard abbreviations include the
following:
â¢  Oral (PO) â the patient swallows a tablet or capsule
â¢  Sublingual (SL) â applied under the tongue
â¢  Enteral (NG or PEG) â administered via a tube directly into the GI tract
â¢  Rectal (PR) â administered via rectal suppository
â¢  Inhalation (INH) â the patient breathes in medication from an inhaler
â¢  Intramuscular (IM) â administered via an injection into a muscle
â¢  Subcutaneous â administered via injection into the fat tissue beneath
the skin (Note that âsubcutaneousâ is on ISMPâs recommended list of
abbreviations to avoid due to common errors.)
â¢  Transdermal (TD) â administered by applying a patch on the skin
Provider Name/Signature
Signature of the prescribing provider is required on the order and can beelectronic or handwritten. Verbal orders from a prescriber are not
recommended, but may be permitted in some agencies for urgent
situations. Verbal orders require the nurse to ârepeat backâ the order to the
prescriber for confirmation.","CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications Components of a Medication Order According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, all orders for

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,"Rights of Medication Administration Each year in the United States, 7,000 to 9,000 people die as a result of a
medication error. Hundreds of thousands of other patients experience
adverse reactions or other complications related to a medication. The total
cost of caring for patients with medication-associated errors exceeds $40
billion each year. In addition to the monetary cost, patients experience
psychological and physical pain and suffering as a result of medication
errors.
Nurses play a vital role in reducing the number of medication
errors that occur by verifying several rights of medication.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requires nurses to verify
specific information prior to the administration of medication to avoid
errors, referred to as verifying the rights of medication administration.
These rights of medication administration are the vital last safety check by
nurses to prevent errors in the chain of medication administration that
includes the prescribing provider, the pharmacist, the nurse, and the
patient.
It is important to remember that if a medication error occurs resulting in
harm to a patient, a nurse can be held liable even if âjust following orders.â
It is absolutely vital for nurses to use critical thinking and clinical judgment
to ensure each medication is safe for each specific patient before
administering it. The consequences of liability resulting from a medication
error can range from being charged with negligence in a court of law, to
losing oneâs job, to losing oneâs nursing license.
The six rights of medication administration must be verified by the nurse
at least three times before administering a medication to a patient. These
1.  Right Patient
2.  Right Drug
3.  Right Dose
4.  Right Time
5.  Right Route
6.  Right Documentation
Recent literature indicates that up to ten rights should be completed as
part of a safe medication administration process. These additional rights
include Right History and Assessment, Right Drug Interactions, Right to
Refuse, and Right Education and Information. Information for each of
these rights is further described below.
Right Patient
Acceptable patient identifiers include, but are not limited to, the patientâs
full name, an identification number assigned by the hospital, or date of
birth. A patientâs room number must never be used as an identifier
because a patient may change rooms. Identifiers must be confirmed by
the patient wristband, patient identification card, patient statement
(when possible), or other means outlined in the agency policy such as a
patient picture included on the MAR. The nurse must confirm the
patientâs identification matches the medication administration record
(MAR) and medication label prior to administration to ensure that the
medication is being given to the correct patient.
See Figure 15.1
for an
illustration of the nurse verifying the patientâs identify by scanning their
identification band and asking for their date of birth. See Figure 15.2
for a
close-up image of a patient identification wristband.
If barcode scanning is used in an agency, this scanning is not intended to
take the place of confirming two patient identifiers, but is intended to add
another layer of safety to the medication administration process. The
National Patient Safety Goals established by the Joint Commission state
that whenever administering patient medications, at least two patient
identifiers should be used.
Right Drug
During this step, the nurse ensures the medication to be administered to
the patient matches the order or Medication Administration Record (MAR)
and that the patient does not have a documented allergy to it.
The
Medication Administration Record (MAR), or eMAR, an electronic medical
record, is a specific type of documentation found in a patientâs chart. See
Figure 15.3
for an image of a MAR and its components. Beware of look-
alike and sound-alike medication names, as well as high-alert medications
that bear a heightened risk of causing significant patient harm if they are
used in error. The nurse should also be aware of what medication can be
crushed and those that cannot be crushed. Read more information about
these concerns using the hyperlinks below.
View the ISMP Frequently Confused Medication List.
View the ISMP High-Alert Medications List.
View the ISMP Do Not Crush List.
Right Dose
the prescribed dose, verifies the correct dosage range for the age and
medical status of the patient, and also confirms that the prescription itself
does not reflect an unsafe dosage level (i.e., a dose that is too high or too
low).
For example, medication errors commonly occur in children, who
typically receive a lower dose of medication than an adult. Medication
errors also commonly occur in older patients who have existing kidney or
liver disease and are unable to metabolize or excrete typical doses of
medications.
Right Time and Frequency
During this step, the nurse verifies adherence to the prescribed frequency
and scheduled time of administration of the medication.
This step is
especially important when PRN medications are administered because it
is up to the nurse to verify the time of the previous dose and compare it to
the ordered frequency.
Medications should be administered on time whenever possible. However,
when multiple patients are scheduled to receive multiple medications at
the same time, this goal of timeliness can be challenging. Most facilities
have a policy that medications can be given within a range of 30 minutes
before or 30 minutes after the medication is scheduled. For example, a
medication ordered for 0800 could be administered anytime between
0730 and 0830. However, some medications must be given at their
specific ordered time due to pharmacokinetics of the drug. For example, if
an antibiotic is scheduled every eight hours, this time frame must be
upheld to maintain effective bioavailability of the drug, but a medication
scheduled daily has more flexibility with time of actual administration.
Right Route
During this step, the nurse ensures the route of administration is
appropriate for the specific medication and also for the patient.
Many
medications can potentially be administered via multiple routes, whereas
other medications can only be given safely via one route. Nurses must
administer medications via the route indicated in the order. If a nurse
discovers an error in the order or believes the route is unsafe for a
particular patient, the route must be clarified with the prescribing
provider before administration. For example, a patient may have a PEG
tube in place, but the nurse notices the medication order indicates the
route of administration as PO. If the nurse believes this medication should
be administered via the PEG tube and the route indicated in the order is
an error, the prescribing provider must be notified and the order must be
revised indicating via PEG tube before the medication is administered.
Right Documentation
After administering medication, it is important to immediately document
the administration to avoid potential errors from an unintended repeat
dose.
In addition to checking the basic rights of medication administration and
documenting the administration, it is also important for nurses to verify
the following information to prevent medication errors.
Right History and Assessment
The nurse should be aware of the patientâs allergies, as well as any history
of any drug interactions. Additionally, nurses collect appropriate
assessment data regarding the patientâs history, current status, and recent
lab results to identify any contraindications for the patients to receive the
prescribed medication.
Right Drug Interactions
The patientâs history should be reviewed for any potential interactions with
medications previously given or with the patientâs diet. It is also important
to verify the medicationâs expiration date before administration.
Right Education and Information
Information should be provided to the patient about the medication,
including the expected therapeutic effects, as well as the potential
adverse effects. The patient should be encouraged to report suspected
side effects to the nurse and/or prescribing provider. If the patient is a
minor, the parent may also have a right to know about the medication in
many states, depending upon the circumstances.
Right of Refusal
After providing education about the medication, the patient has the right
to refuse to take medication in accordance with the Nurses Code of Ethics
and respect for individual patient autonomy. If a patient refuses to take
the medication after proper education has been performed, the event
should be documented in the patient chart and the prescribing provider
notified.","CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications Rights of Medication Administration Each year in the United States, 7,000 to 9,000 people die as a result of a
medication error. Hundreds of thousands of other patients experience
adverse reactions or other complications related to a medication. The total
cost of caring for patients with medication-associated errors exceeds $40
billion each year. In addition to the monetary cost, patients experience
psychological and physical pain and suffering as a result of medication
errors.
Nurses play a vital role in reducing the number of medication
errors that occur by verifying several rights of medication.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requires nurses to verify
specific information prior to the administration of medication to avoid
errors, referred to as verifying the rights of medication administration.
These rights of medication administration are the vital last safety check by
nurses to prevent errors in the chain of medication administration that
includes the prescribing provider, the pharmacist, the nurse, and the
patient.
It is important to remember that if a medication error occurs resulting in
harm to a patient, a nurse can be held liable even if âjust following orders.â
It is absolutely vital for nurses to use critical thinking and clinical judgment
to ensure each medication is safe for each specific patient before
administering it. The consequences of liability resulting from a medication
error can range from being charged with negligence in a court of law, to
losing oneâs job, to losing oneâs nursing license.
The six rights of medication administration must be verified by the nurse
at least three times before administering a medication to a patient. These
1.  Right Patient
2.  Right Drug
3.  Right Dose
4.  Right Time
5.  Right Route
6.  Right Documentation
Recent literature indicates that up to ten rights should be completed as
part of a safe medication administration process. These additional rights
include Right History and Assessment, Right Drug Interactions, Right to
Refuse, and Right Education and Information. Information for each of
these rights is further described below.
Right Patient
Acceptable patient identifiers include, but are not limited to, the patientâs
full name, an identification number assigned by the hospital, or date of
birth. A patientâs room number must never be used as an identifier
because a patient may change rooms. Identifiers must be confirmed by
the patient wristband, patient identification card, patient statement
(when possible), or other means outlined in the agency policy such as a
patient picture included on the MAR. The nurse must confirm the
patientâs identification matches the medication administration record
(MAR) and medication label prior to administration to ensure that the
medication is being given to the correct patient.
See Figure 15.1
for an
illustration of the nurse verifying the patientâs identify by scanning their
identification band and asking for their date of birth. See Figure 15.2
for a
close-up image of a patient identification wristband.
If barcode scanning is used in an agency, this scanning is not intended to
take the place of confirming two patient identifiers, but is intended to add
another layer of safety to the medication administration process. The
National Patient Safety Goals established by the Joint Commission state
that whenever administering patient medications, at least two patient
identifiers should be used.
Right Drug
During this step, the nurse ensures the medication to be administered to
the patient matches the order or Medication Administration Record (MAR)
and that the patient does not have a documented allergy to it.
The
Medication Administration Record (MAR), or eMAR, an electronic medical
record, is a specific type of documentation found in a patientâs chart. See
Figure 15.3
for an image of a MAR and its components. Beware of look-
alike and sound-alike medication names, as well as high-alert medications
that bear a heightened risk of causing significant patient harm if they are
used in error. The nurse should also be aware of what medication can be
crushed and those that cannot be crushed. Read more information about
these concerns using the hyperlinks below.
View the ISMP Frequently Confused Medication List.
View the ISMP High-Alert Medications List.
View the ISMP Do Not Crush List.
Right Dose
the prescribed dose, verifies the correct dosage range for the age and
medical status of the patient, and also confirms that the prescription itself
does not reflect an unsafe dosage level (i.e., a dose that is too high or too
low).
For example, medication errors commonly occur in children, who
typically receive a lower dose of medication than an adult. Medication
errors also commonly occur in older patients who have existing kidney or
liver disease and are unable to metabolize or excrete typical doses of
medications.
Right Time and Frequency
During this step, the nurse verifies adherence to the prescribed frequency
and scheduled time of administration of the medication.
This step is
especially important when PRN medications are administered because it
is up to the nurse to verify the time of the previous dose and compare it to
the ordered frequency.
Medications should be administered on time whenever possible. However,
when multiple patients are scheduled to receive multiple medications at
the same time, this goal of timeliness can be challenging. Most facilities
have a policy that medications can be given within a range of 30 minutes
before or 30 minutes after the medication is scheduled. For example, a
medication ordered for 0800 could be administered anytime between
0730 and 0830. However, some medications must be given at their
specific ordered time due to pharmacokinetics of the drug. For example, if
an antibiotic is scheduled every eight hours, this time frame must be
upheld to maintain effective bioavailability of the drug, but a medication
scheduled daily has more flexibility with time of actual administration.
Right Route
During this step, the nurse ensures the route of administration is
appropriate for the specific medication and also for the patient.
Many
medications can potentially be administered via multiple routes, whereas
other medications can only be given safely via one route. Nurses must
administer medications via the route indicated in the order. If a nurse
discovers an error in the order or believes the route is unsafe for a
particular patient, the route must be clarified with the prescribing
provider before administration. For example, a patient may have a PEG
tube in place, but the nurse notices the medication order indicates the
route of administration as PO. If the nurse believes this medication should
be administered via the PEG tube and the route indicated in the order is
an error, the prescribing provider must be notified and the order must be
revised indicating via PEG tube before the medication is administered.

After administering medication, it is important to immediately document
the administration to avoid potential errors from an unintended repeat
dose.
In addition to checking the basic rights of medication administration and
documenting the administration, it is also important for nurses to verify
the following information to prevent medication errors.

of any drug interactions. Additionally, nurses collect appropriate
assessment data regarding the patientâs history, current status, and recent

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,"Medication Dispensing Medications are dispensed for patients in a variety of methods. During
inpatient care, unit dose packaging is a common method for dispensing
medications. See Figure 15.4
for an image of unit dose packaging.
Unit dose dispensing is typically used in association with a medication
dispensing system, sometimes referred to in practice with brand names
such as âPyxisâ or âOmnicell.â Medication dispensing systems help keep
medications secure by requiring a user sign-in and password. They also
reduce medication errors by only allowing medications prescribed for a
specific patient to be removed unless additional actions are taken.
However, it is important to remember that medication errors can still
occur when using a medication dispensing system if the incorrect
medication is erroneously stocked in a compartment. See Figure 15.5
for
an image of a medication dispensing system.
Bar codes are often incorporated with unit dose medication dispensing as
an additional layer of safety to prevent medication errors. Each patient and
medication is identified with a unique bar code. The nurse scans the
patientâs identification wristband with a bedside portable device and then
display error messages if an incorrect medication is scanned or if
medication is scanned at an incorrect time. It is vital for nurses to stop and
investigate the medication administration process when an error is
received. The scanning device is typically linked to an electronic MAR and
the medication administered is documented immediately in the patientâs
chart.
In long-term care agencies, weekly blister cards may be used that contain
a specific patientâs medications for each day of the week. See Figure 15.6
for an image of a blister pack.
Agencies using blister cards or pill bags typically store medications in a
locked medication cart to keep them secure. Supplies used to administer
medications are also stored on the cart. The MAR is available in printed21 for an
format or electronically with a laptop computer. See Figure 15.7image of a medication cart.","CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications Medication Dispensing Medications are dispensed for patients in a variety of methods. During

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,"Process of Medication Administration No matter what method of medication storage and dispensing is used in a
facility, the nurse must continue to verify the rights of medication
administration to perform an accurate and safe medication pass. Using amedication dispensing system or bar coding does not substitute for
verifying the rights, but are used to add an additional layer of safety to
medication administration. Nurses can also avoid medication errors by
creating a habitual process of performing medication checks when
administering medication. The rights of medication administration should
be done in the following order:
1.  Perform the first check as the unit dose package, blister pack, or pill
bag is removed from the dispensing machine or medication cart. Also,
check the expiration date of the medication.
2.  A second check should be performed after the medication is removed
from the dispensing machine or medication cart. This step should be
performed prior to pouring or removing from a multidose container.
Note: Some high-alert medications, such as insulin, require a second
nurse to perform a medication check at this step due to potentially
life-threatening adverse effects that can occur if an error is made.
3.  The third check should be performed immediately before
administering the medication to the patient at the bedside or when
replacing the multidose container back into the drawer.
See Figure 15.8
22 for an image of a nurse comparing medication
information on the medication packet to information on the patientâs
MAR.
When performing these three checks, the nurse should ensure this is the
right medication, right patient, right dosage, right route, and right time.
See Figure 15.9
23 for an image of the nurse performing patient
identification prior to administering the medication. The sixth right,
correct documentation, should be done immediately after the medication
is administered to the patient to avoid an error from another nurse
inadvertently administering the dose a second time.  These six rights
completed three times have greatly reduced medication errors.
As discussed earlier, other rights to consider during this process are as
follows:
â¢  Is the patient receiving this medication for the right reason?
â¢  Have the right assessments been performed prior to giving the
medication?
â¢  Has the patient also received the right education regarding the
medications?
â¢  Is the patient exhibiting the right response to the medication?
â¢  Is the patient refusing to take the medication? Patients have the right
to refuse medication. The patientâs refusal and any education or
explanation provided related to the attempt to administer the
medication should be documented by the nurse and the prescribing
provider should be notified.
â¢  Listen to the patient if they verbalize any
concerns about medications. Explore their
concerns, verify the order, and/or discuss
their concerns with the prescribing provider
before administering the medication to
avoid a potential medication error.
â¢  If a pill falls on the floor, it is contaminated and should
not be administered. Dispose the medication according
to agency policy.
â¢  Be aware of absorption considerations of the
medications you are administering. For example, certain
medications such as levothyroxine should be
administered on an empty stomach because food and
â¢  Nurses are often the first to notice when a patient has
difficulty swallowing. If you notice a patient coughs
immediately after swallowing water or has a âgurglingâ
sound to their voice, do not administer any medications,
food, or fluid until you have reported your concerns to
the heath care provider. A swallow evaluation may be
needed and the route of medication may need to be
changed from oral to another route to avoid aspiration.
â¢  If your patient has a nothing by mouth (NPO) order,
verify if this includes all medications. This information
may be included on the MAR or the orders, and if not,
verify this information with the provider. Some
medications, such as diabetes medication, may be
given with a sip of water in some situations where the
patient has NPO status.
â¢  If the route of administration is not accurately listed on
the MAR, contact the prescribing provider before
administering the medication. For example, a patient
may have a PEG tube but the medication is erroneously
listed as âPOâ on the order.

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,"Substances Controlled substances, also called Scheduled Medications, are kept in a
locked system and accounted for using a checks and balance system.
Removal of a controlled substance from a medication dispensing system
must be verified and documented by a second nurse witness. Removal of
a controlled substance from a medication cart needs to be documented
on an additional controlled substance record with the patientâs name, the
actual amount of substance given, the time it was given, associated pre-
assessment data, and the name of the nurse administering the controlled
substance.
Controlled substances stored in locked areas of medication carts must
also be counted at every shift change by two nurses and then compared
to the controlled substance administration record. If the count does not
match the documentation record, the discrepancy must be reported
immediately according to agency policy.
Additionally, if a partial dose of a controlled substance is administered, the
remainder of the substance must be discarded in front of another nurse
witness to document the event. This process is called âwasting.â Follow
agency policy regarding wasting of controlled substances.
These additional safety measures help to prevent drug diversion, the use
of a prescription medication for other than its intended purpose.","CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications Substances Controlled substances, also called Scheduled Medications, are kept in a

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,"Oral Medication Administration Most medications are administered orally because it is the most
convenient and least invasive route for the patient. Medication given orally
has a slower onset, typically about 30-60 minutes. Prior to oral
administration of medications, ensure the patient has no
contraindications to receiving oral medication, is able to swallow, and is
not on gastric suction. If the patient has difficulty swallowing (dysphagia),
tablets are typically crushed and placed in a substance like applesauce or
pudding for easier swallowing (based on the patientâs prescribed diet).
However, it is important to verify that a tablet may be crushed by
consulting a drug reference or a pharmacist. For example, medications
such as enteric-coated tablets, capsules, and sustained-release or long-
acting drugs should never be crushed because doing so will affect the
intended action of the medication. In this event, the provider must be
contacted for a change in route.
Position the patient receiving oral medication in an upright position to
decrease the risk of aspiration. Patients should remain in this position for
30 minutes after medication administration, if possible. If a patient is
unable to sit, assist them into a side-lying position. See Figure 15.10
25 for an
image of a nurse positioning the patient in an upright position prior to
medication administration. Offer a glass of water or other oral fluid (that is
not contraindicated with the medication) to ease swallowing and improve
absorption and dissolution of the medication, taking any fluid restrictions
into account.
Remain with the patient until all medication has been swallowed before
documenting to verify the medication has been administered.
If any post-assessments are required, follow up in the appropriate time
frame. For example, when administering oral pain medication, follow up
approximately 30 minutes to an hour after medication is given to ensure
effective pain relief.
If medication is given sublingual (under the tongue) or buccal (between
the cheek and gum) the mouth should be moist. Offering the patient a
drink of water prior to giving the medication can help with absorption.
Instruct the patient to allow the medication to completely dissolve, and
reinforce the importance of not swallowing or chewing the medication.
Liquid medications are available in multidose vials or single-dose
containers. It may be necessary to shake liquid medications if they are
suspensions prior to pouring. Make sure the label is clearly written and
easy to read. When pouring a liquid medication, it is ideal to place the
label in the palm of your hand so if any liquid medication runs down the
outside of the bottle it does not blur the writing and make the label
unidentifiable. When pouring liquid medication, read the dose at eye level
measuring at the meniscus of the poured fluid. Always follow specific
agency policy and procedure when administering oral medications.","CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications Oral Medication Administration Most medications are administered orally because it is the most

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,"Rectal Medication Administration Drugs administered rectally have a faster action than the oral route and a
higher bioavailability, meaning a higher amount of effective drug in the
bloodstream because it has not been influenced by upper gastrointestinal
tract digestive processes. Rectal administration also reduces side effects of
some drugs, such as gastric irritation, nausea, and vomiting. Rectal
gastrointestinal system (e.g., laxatives) or their systemic effects (e.g.,
analgesics when oral route is contraindicated). Rectal medications are
contraindicated after rectal or bowel surgery, with rectal bleeding or
prolapse, and with low platelet counts.
Rectal medications are often formulated as suppositories. Suppositories
are small, cone-shaped objects that melt inside the body and release
medication. When administering rectal suppositories, the patient should
be placed on their left side in the Sims position. See Figure 15.11
for an
image of patient positioning during rectal medication administration. The
suppository and gloved index finger placing the suppository should be
lubricated for ease of placement. Suppositories are conical and should be
placed into the rectum rounded side first. The suppository should be
inserted past the sphincter along the wall of the rectum. After placement,
the patient should remain on their side while the medication takes effect.
This time period is specific to each medication, but typically is at least 5
minutes. Make sure to avoid placing the suppository into stool. It is also
important to monitor for a vasovagal response when placing medications
rectally. A vasovagal response can occur when the vagus nerve is
stimulated, causing the patientâs blood pressure and heart rate to drop,
and creating symptoms of dizziness and perspiration. Sometimes the
patient can faint or even have a seizure. Patients with a history of cardiac
arrhythmias should not be administered rectal suppositories due to the
potential for a vasovagal response. Always follow agency policy and
procedure when administering rectal medications.
Another type of rectal medication is an enema. An enema is the
administration of a substance in liquid form into the rectum.  Many
enemas are formulated in disposable plastic containers. Warming the
solution to body temperature prior to administration may be beneficial
because cold solution can cause cramping. It is also helpful to encourage
the patient to empty their bladder prior to administration to reduce
feelings of discomfort. Place an incontinence pad under the patient and
position them on their left side in the Sims position. Lubricate the nozzleof the container and expel air. Insert the lubricated nozzle into the rectum
slowly and gently expel the contents into the rectum. Ask the patient to
retain the enema based on manufacturerâs recommendations.","CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications Rectal Medication Administration Drugs administered rectally have a faster action than the oral route and a
higher bioavailability, meaning a higher amount of effective drug in the
bloodstream because it has not been influenced by upper gastrointestinal
tract digestive processes. Rectal administration also reduces side effects of
some drugs, such as gastric irritation, nausea, and vomiting. Rectal
gastrointestinal system (e.g., laxatives) or their systemic effects (e.g.,
analgesics when oral route is contraindicated). Rectal medications are
contraindicated after rectal or bowel surgery, with rectal bleeding or
prolapse, and with low platelet counts.
Rectal medications are often formulated as suppositories. Suppositories
are small, cone-shaped objects that melt inside the body and release
medication. When administering rectal suppositories, the patient should
be placed on their left side in the Sims position. See Figure 15.11
for an
image of patient positioning during rectal medication administration. The
suppository and gloved index finger placing the suppository should be
lubricated for ease of placement. Suppositories are conical and should be
placed into the rectum rounded side first. The suppository should be
inserted past the sphincter along the wall of the rectum. After placement,
the patient should remain on their side while the medication takes effect.
This time period is specific to each medication, but typically is at least 5
minutes. Make sure to avoid placing the suppository into stool. It is also
important to monitor for a vasovagal response when placing medications
rectally. A vasovagal response can occur when the vagus nerve is
stimulated, causing the patientâs blood pressure and heart rate to drop,
and creating symptoms of dizziness and perspiration. Sometimes the
patient can faint or even have a seizure. Patients with a history of cardiac
arrhythmias should not be administered rectal suppositories due to the
potential for a vasovagal response. Always follow agency policy and
procedure when administering rectal medications.
Another type of rectal medication is an enema. An enema is the
administration of a substance in liquid form into the rectum.  Many
enemas are formulated in disposable plastic containers. Warming the
solution to body temperature prior to administration may be beneficial
because cold solution can cause cramping. It is also helpful to encourage
the patient to empty their bladder prior to administration to reduce
feelings of discomfort. Place an incontinence pad under the patient and
position them on their left side in the Sims position. Lubricate the nozzleof the container and expel air. Insert the lubricated nozzle into the rectum
slowly and gently expel the contents into the rectum. Ask the patient to
retain the enema based on manufacturerâs recommendations.",651
CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,"Enteral Tube Medication Administration Medication is administered via an enteral tube when the patient is unable
to orally swallow medication. Medications given through an enteral
feeding tube (nasogastric, nasointestinal, percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy {PEG}, or jejunostomy {J} tube) should be in liquid form
whenever possible to avoid clogging the tube. If a liquid form is not
available, medications that are safe to crush should be crushed finely and
dissolved in water to keep the tube from becoming clogged. If a
medication is not safe to crush, the prescribing provider should be
notified and a prescription for alternative medication obtained. Capsules
should be opened and emptied into liquid as indicated prior to
administration, and liquids should be administered at room temperature.
Keep in mind that some capsules are time-released and should not be
opened. In this case, contact the provider for a change in order.
As always, follow agency policy for this medication administration
procedure. Position the patient to at least 30 degrees and in high Fowlerâs
position when feasible. If gastric suctioning is in place, turn off the
suctioning. See Figure 15.12
for an image of a nurse positioning the
patient prior to administration of medications via a PEG tube. Follow the
tube to the point of entry into the patient to ensure you are accessing the
correct tube.
Prior to medication administration, verify tube placement. Placement is
initially verified immediately after the tube is placed with an X-ray, and the
nurse should verify these results. Additionally, bedside placement is
verified by the nurse before every medication pass. There are multiple
evidence-based methods used to check placement. One method includes
aspirating tube contents with a 60-mL syringe and observing the fluid.
Fasting gastric secretions appear grassy-green, brown, or clear and
colorless, whereas secretions from a tube that has perforated the pleural
space typically have a pale yellow serous appearance. A second method
used to verify placement is to measure the pH of aspirate from the tube.
Fasting gastric pH is usually 5 or less, even in patients receiving gastric
acid inhibitors. Fluid aspirated from a tube in the pleural space typically37,38 Note that installation of air into the tube whilehas a pH of 7 or higher.listening over the stomach with a stethoscope is no longer considered a
safe method to check tube placement according to evidence-based
practices.
After tube placement is checked, a clean 60-mL syringe is used to flush
the tube with a minimum of 15 mL of water (5-10 mL for children) before
administering the medication. Follow agency policy regarding flushing
amount. Liquid medication, or appropriately crushed medication
dissolved in water, is administered one medication at a time. Medication
should not be mixed because of the risks of physical and chemical
incompatibilities, tube obstruction, and altered therapeutic drug
responses. Between each medication, the tube is flushed with 15 mL of
water, keeping in mind the patientâs fluid volume status. After the final
medication is administered, the tube is flushed with 15 mL of water. The
tube is then clamped, or if the patient is receiving tube feeding, it can berestarted. If the patient is receiving gastric suctioning, it can be restarted
30 minutes after medication administration.image of a nurse administering medication via an enteral tube.
See Figure 15.13
43 for an
Special considerations during this procedure include the following:
â¢  If the patient has fluid restrictions, the amount of fluid used to flush
the tube between each medication may need to be modified to avoid
excess fluid intake.
â¢  If the tube is attached to suctioning, the suctioning should be left off
for 20 to 30 minutes after the medication is given to promote
absorption of the medication.
â¢  If the patient is receiving tube feedings, review information about the
drugs that are being administered. If they cannot be taken with food
or need to be taken on an empty stomach, the tube feeding running
time will need to be adjusted.
â¢  Be sure to document the amount of water used to flush the tube
during the medication pass on the fluid intake record.
â¢  If the patient has a chronic illness or is immunosuppressed, sterile
water is suggested for use of mixing and flushing instead of tap water.
â¢  Enteric-coated medications and other medications on the âDo Not
Crush Listâ should not be crushed for this procedure. Instead, the
prescribing provider must be notified and an order for a different form
of the medication must be obtained.
â¢  If the tube becomes clogged, attempt to flush it with water. If
unsuccessful, notify the provider and a pancreatic enzyme solution or
kit may be ordered before a new tube is placed.

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,"Preventing Medication Errors Medication errors can occur at various stages of the medication
administration process, beginning with the prescribing provider, to the
pharmacist preparing the medication, to the pharmacy technician
stocking the medication, to the nurse administering the medication.
Medication errors are most common at the ordering or prescribing stage.
Typical errors include the prescribing provider writing the wrong
medication, wrong route or dose, or the wrong frequency. These ordering
errors account for almost 50% of medication errors. Data shows that
nurses and pharmacists identify anywhere from 30% to 70% of
medication-ordering errors.
One of the major causes for medication errors is a distraction. Nearly 75%
of medication errors have been attributed to this cause.
To minimize
distractions, hospitals have introduced measures to reduce medication
errors. For example, some hospitals set a âno-interruption zone policyâ
during medication dispensing and preparation and ask health care team
members to only disrupt the medication administration process for
emergencies. To reduce medication errors, agencies are also adopting
many initiatives developed by the World Health Organization (WHO),
48 the
Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), the Institute of Medicine
(IOM),
and several other organizations. Initiatives include measures such
as avoiding error-prone abbreviations, being aware of commonly confused
medications. Student nurses must also be aware of conditions that may
contribute to making a medication error during their clinical courses.

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,"Reporting Medication Errors Despite multiple initiatives that have been instituted to prevent
medication errors, including properly checking the rights of medication
administration, medication errors happen. Examples of common errors
include administering the wrong dose or an unsafe dose, giving
medication to the wrong patient, administering medication by the wrong
route or at the incorrect rate, and giving a drug that is expired. If a
medication error occurs, the nurse must follow specific steps of reporting
according to agency policy. In the past when medication errors occurred,
the individual who caused it was usually blamed for the mishap and
disciplinary action resulted. However, this culture of blame has shifted,
and many medication errors by well-trained and careful nurses and other
health care professions are viewed as potential symptoms of a system-
wide problem. This philosophy is referred to as an institutionâs safety
culture. Thus, rather than focusing on disciplinary action, agencies are
now trying to understand how the system failed causing the error to
occur. This approach is designed to introduce safeguards at every level so
that a mistake can be caught before the drug is given to the patient,
which is often referred to as a ânear miss.â For an agency to effectively
institute a safety culture, all medication errors and near misses must be
reported.
When a medication error occurs, the nurseâs first response should be to
effects from the medication. Secondly, the nurse must notify the nurse
manager and prescribing provider of the error. The provider may provide
additional orders to counteract the medicationâs effects or to monitor for
potential adverse reactions. In some situations, family members of the
patient who are legal guardians or powers of attorney should also be
notified. Lastly, a written report should be submitted documenting the
incident, often referred to as an incident report. Incident reports are
intended to identify if patterns of errors are occurring due to system-wide
processes that can be modified to prevent future errors.","CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications Reporting Medication Errors Despite multiple initiatives that have been instituted to prevent

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications,"Life Span Considerations Children
It can be difficult to persuade children to take medications. It is often
helpful for medications to be prescribed in liquid or chewable form. For
example, droppers are used for infants or very young children; the
medication should be placed between the gum and cheek to prevent
aspiration. Mixing medication with soft foods can also be helpful to
encourage the child to swallow medications, but it is best to avoid mixing
the medication with a staple food in the childâs diet because of potential
later refusal of the food associated with medication administration. It can
be helpful to offer the child a cool item, such as a popsicle or frozen fruit
bar, prior to medication administration to numb the childâs tongue and
decrease the taste of the medication. Other clinical tips for medication
administration include asking the caregiver how the child takes
medications at home and mimicking this method or asking the caregiver
Oral syringes (without needles attached) may be used to administer
precise dosages of medication to children.  See Figure 15.14
of a nurse
administering oral medication to a child with an oral syringe. When
administering medication with an oral syringe, remember to remove the
cap prior to administration because this could be a choking hazard. It is
also important to educate the caregiver of the child how to properly
administer the medication at the correct dosage at home.
Older Adults
Many older adults have a âpolypharmacy,â meaning many medications to
keep track of and multiple times these medications need to be taken per
day. Nurses should help patients set up a schedule to remember when to
and time is a very helpful strategy. See Figure 15.15
of a medication box.
Nurses can suggest to patients to have all medications filled at the same
pharmacy to avoid drug-drug interactions that can occur when multiple
providers are prescribing medications.
Older adults often have difficulty swallowing, so obtaining a prescription
for liquid medication or crushing the medication when applicable and
placing it in applesauce or pudding is helpful. Allow extra time when
administering medication to an older adult to give them time to ask
questions and to swallow multiple pills. Monitor for adverse effects and
drug interactions in older adults, who are often taking multiple
medications and may have preexisting kidney or liver dysfunction.
Be sure to address the economic needs of an older adult as it relates to
their medications.  Medications can be expensive and many older adults
live on a strict budget. Nurses often advocate for less expensive
alternatives for patients, such as using a generic brand instead of a name
brand or a less expensive class of medication. Be aware that an older adult
with financial concerns may try to save money by not taking medications
as frequently as prescribed.  Also, the older adult may âfeel goodâ on their
medications and think they donât need to monitor or take medications
because they are âcured.â Reinforce that âfeeling goodâ usually means the
medication is working as prescribed and should continue to be taken.
Finally, empower patients to take control of managing their health by
providing education and ongoing support.","CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.2 Basic Concepts of Administering Medications Life Span Considerations Children

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.3 Assessments Related to Medication Administration,"Pre-Administration In addition to verifying the rights of medication administration three
times, the nurse should also perform focused assessments of the patientâs
current status and anticipate actions of the medications and potential
side effects.  Here are some examples of pre-assessments before
administering medication:
â¢  Check Vital Signs. Before administering cardiac medication, the
patientâs blood pressure and heart rate are typically assessed to ensure
they are within range of parameters for administration. For example, a
patient is scheduled to receive a blood pressure medication, but their
current blood pressure is 90/50, so the medication is withheld based
on parameters stated on the MAR to withhold the medication if the
systolic blood pressure is less than 100. If parameters are not provided,
it is the nurseâs responsibility to use clinical judgment and follow up
with the prescribing provider with concerns before administering the
medication.
inhaled respiratory medications such as albuterol for asthma or
chronic pulmonary disease, the O2 saturation, heart rate, respiratory
rate, and lungs sounds are typically assessed. The patientâs response to
the medication is then compared to pre-assessment data to
determine effectiveness.
â¢  Review Lab Results. Before administering a diuretic such as
furosemide, the nurse assesses the patientâs potassium level in recent
lab work results. If the potassium level is lower than normal range, the
nurse withholds the medication and notifies the prescribing provider.
â¢  Perform a Pain Assessment. Before administering pain medication,
the nurse performs a thorough pain assessment based on the
mnemonic PQRSTU. (See more information about the PQRSTU
mnemonic in the âHealth Historyâ chapter.) The patientâs response to
the medication after it is received is then compared to pre-assessment
data to determine effectiveness.","CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.3 Assessments Related to Medication Administration Pre-Administration In addition to verifying the rights of medication administration three

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.3 Assessments Related to Medication Administration,"During Administration The nurse continues to assess safety during administration of medication,
such as sudden changes in condition or difficulty swallowing. For example,
if a patient suddenly becomes dizzy, the administration of cardiac
medication is postponed until further assessments are performed. If a
patient starts to cough, choke, or speak in a gurgly voice during oral or
tube administration of medication, the procedure should be stopped and
further assessments performed.

CHAPTER 15 ADMINISTRATION OF ENTERAL MEDICATIONS 15.3 Assessments Related to Medication Administration,"Post-Administration: Right Response In addition to documenting the medication administration, the nurse
evaluates the patient after medications have been administered to
monitor the efficacy of the drug. For example, if a patient reported a pain
level of â8â before PRN pain medication was administered, the nurse
evaluates the patientâs pain level after administration to ensure the pain
level is decreasing and the pain medication was effective. This evaluation
data is documented in the patientâs chart.
Additionally, the nurse continually monitors for adverse effects from all of
a patientâs medications. For example, the first dose of an antibiotic was
administered to a patient during a previous shift, but the nurse notices the
patient has developed a rash. The nurse notifies the prescribing provider
of the change in condition and anticipates new orders or changes in the

ROUTES 16.2 Basic Concepts,"Topical and Transdermal Medications Topical medications are medications that are administered via the skin or
mucous membranes for direct local action, as well as for systemic effects.
An innunction is a medication that is massaged or rubbed into the skin
and includes topical creams such as nystatin antifungal cream. The
transdermal route of medication administration includes patches or disks
applied to the skin that deliver medication over an extended period of
time. Common types of  transdermal medications are analgesics (such as
fentanyl), cardiac medications (such as nitroglycerin), hormones (such as
estrogen), and nicotine patches (for smoking cessation). See Figure 16.1
for
an image of typical packaging of a topical patch. Medications delivered
transdermally provide a consistent level of the drug in the bloodstream for
distribution. The transdermal route is also helpful for patients who are
nauseated or having difficulty swallowing.
Heat may be applied with the administration of some inunctions. Heat
causes vasodilation that enhances blood flow and improves absorption of
some medication. However, heat should never be applied over patches,
such as the fentanyl or nitroglycerin patches, because it increases the
release of the drug and can cause overdose and death. Be sure to
heat.
When applying transdermal patches, the nurse should always wear gloves
and check the rights of medication administration as is done with other
types of medication. Before applying a new patch, the old patch should be
removed, the skin around the old patch should be assessed, and the site
for the patch cleansed and dried thoroughly. The skin around the patch
should be monitored for any irritation or reaction to the medication or
patch adhesive. Patches should not be applied to broken or irritated skin.
When applying a new patch, the nurse should remove the clear plastic
backing and take care to not touch the medication surface of the patch
while placing it on the patientâs skin. Patches should be placed on an
appropriate skin area per manufacturer guidelines, such as the upper
arms or on the chest. The patch should be pressed firmly to the skin for
ten seconds to ensure adhesion to the skin. For documentation purposes,
the nurse should initial, date, and time a piece of tape that is applied close
to the patch. The patch should not be written on directly because this may
puncture the patch and cause it to become ineffective. Based on the
onset of the medication, the patient should be evaluated to ensure they
are responding appropriately to the therapeutic effects of the medication
and not experiencing any adverse effects.
Patch placement should be routinely assessed for dislodgement per
agency policy. For example, for some opioid patches like fentanyl, the
nurse is required to assess and document that the patch is present during
every shift. The nurse should also be aware that patches with aluminum
backing can cause issues with defibrillation and MRI scans, so this type of
patch should be removed prior to either of these actions.
To remove a patch, the nurse should wear gloves and remove the patch
carefully so as not to tear the skin. The patch should be disposed of in the
proper waste receptacle per agency policy. For example, some agencies
have specific receptacles for nitroglycerin patches. Additionally, agencies
have specific policies for disposal of fentanyl patches to prevent drug
diversion of used patches. Patch removal should be documented in the
patientâs record.","ROUTES 16.2 Basic Concepts Topical and Transdermal Medications Topical medications are medications that are administered via the skin or

ROUTES 16.2 Basic Concepts,"Eye Instillations and Irrigations Eye Drops
Eye drops are administered for a local effect on the eye. Examples of eye
medication to reduce intraocular pressure, and saline drops to relieve dry
eyes. The amount of drops to administer per eye is indicated on the
provider order. When instilling eye drops, the nurse should perform hand
hygiene, apply gloves, and check the same rights of medication
administration as done with other types of medication. Prior to
administration of eye medication, the patientâs eyes should be assessed
for new or unusual redness or drainage. If discharge is present, the eyelids
should be cleansed with gauze saturated with warm water or normal
saline to remove any dirt or debris that could be carried into the eye
during instillation. When cleaning the eyelids, the nurse should clean from
the inner canthus toward the outer canthus so as not to introduce debris
or dirt into the lacrimal ducts that could cause an infection. A new gauze
pad is used for each stroke. The nurse should remove gloves after
cleansing, perform hand hygiene, and apply new gloves prior to
medication administration.
When administering the drops, the patient should be instructed to tilt
their head backwards or be positioned in a supine position with their head
on a pillow looking up. When the cap of the medication is removed, it
should be placed on a clean surface with care taken to keep the inside of
the cap sterile and to not contaminate the dropper tip. The patient should
look up and away while the nurse gently uses pressure to pull the lower lid
down and expose the lower conjunctival sac. By holding the dropper close
to the sac without touching it, the nurse should squeeze the bottle and
allow the drop to fall into the sac, taking care to not touch the dropper to
the eye. After the eye drop has been instilled, the patient should close
their eye. The nurse should apply gentle pressure to the inner canthus,
when appropriate, to prevent the medication from entering the lacrimal
duct and causing a possible systemic reaction to the medication. This
procedure should be repeated in the other eye as ordered. The patient
should be instructed to not to rub their eye(s). During the procedure, the
nurse evaluates the patientâs tolerance of the medication and the
procedure and documents it. See Figure 16.2administering eye drops.

Video Review of Administering EyeDrops
Eye Ointment
Administering eye ointment follows the same procedure as administering
eye drops, except that instead of drops, Â½ inch of ointment is placed in the
lower conjunctival sac. When applying the ointment, the nurse should
start at the inner canthus and move outward.  After application, the
patient should be instructed to close their eyelid and move the eye to
spread the ointment so it is absorbed. They should be advised they may
experience blurry vision for a few minutes until the medication is
absorbed.
Eye Irrigations
Eye irrigations are used to flush foreign bodies from the eye, such as
debris or chemicals, using large amounts of saline. The amount of solution
and length of time used to irrigate the eye depends on the contaminant.
Follow agency policy when performing eye irrigation. For example, some
emergency eye flush stations provide a 15-minute flush to the eye. Care
should be taken to not contaminate the other eye while removing the
debris unless it is necessary to flush both eyes.","ROUTES 16.2 Basic Concepts Eye Instillations and Irrigations Eye Drops

ROUTES 16.2 Basic Concepts,"Ear Instillations and Irrigations Medications and fluids may be instilled into the ear for local effect,including antibiotics, analgesics, wax softeners, and irrigation fluid to
remove foreign objects or wax buildup.  Medications and fluids are
instilled into the outer ear canal, with the tympanic membrane forming a
thin barrier to the middle and inner ear. However, if the tympanic
membrane is ruptured, instillation of ear drops is generally
contraindicated unless a sterile, no-touch technique is used. However, if a
patient has a surgical opening in the tympanic membrane (i.e.,
tympanostomy tubes have been placed), ear drops may be prescribed but
caution must be taken not to introduce debris into the middle or inner air.
Ear Drops
When administering ear drops, the nurse should carefully follow the
dosage and amount of drops per ear according to the provider order. The
nurse should perform hand hygiene, apply gloves, and check the same
rights of medication administration as is completed with other types of
medication. The external ear should be cleaned of debris prior to drops
being instilled. The patient should be positioned so the affected ear is
tilted in the uppermost position. If the patient is lying in bed, position the
patient so they are lying with the unaffected ear against the pillow and
the affected ear upward. When removing the cap of the medication,
caution should be used to not touch the dropper or the inside of the cap
to avoid contamination. The pinna of the ear should be grasped and
pulled backwards and upwards for an adult. For children, the pinna should
be pulled straight back, and for infants, it should be pulled down and
back. This movement straightens the auditory canal and prepares it for
instillation. The nurse should squeeze the bottle so that the drops of
medication fall onto the side of the auditory canal and not directly onto
the tympanic membrane. The medication should run towards the
tympanic membrane after it is instilled. The tragus can be massaged to
help move the medication into place. The patient should remain in this
lying position for five minutes. After five minutes, this procedure can be
repeated on the other ear, if ordered. Evaluation of the patient should be
performed post administration to assess if the patient tolerated theprocedure and if anticipated therapeutic effects occurred. When instilling
medication or fluids into the ear, monitor for side effects such as dizziness
or nausea. See Figure 16.3
for an image of a nurse administering ear
drops.
Ear Irrigations
Ear irrigations are typically performed to remove wax buildup or foreign
bodies from the external ear canal. Normal saline at room temperature is
typically used, although a mixture of saline and hydrogen peroxide can
also be used. A 60-cc needleless syringe is typically used to irrigate the ear,
or a spray bottle with a soft angio catheter can also be used. Ask the
patient to hold an emesis basin under the ear to catch the expelled
for side effects such as dizziness, nausea or pain.","ROUTES 16.2 Basic Concepts Ear Instillations and Irrigations Medications and fluids may be instilled into the ear for local effect,including antibiotics, analgesics, wax softeners, and irrigation fluid to

hand hygiene, apply gloves, perform the same rights of medication
administration as is completed with other types of medications, and

placed, insert the rounded end of the suppository with your index finger,
placing it along the posterior wall of the vagina. Ask the patient to remain
in the supine position for 5-10 minutes for optimal absorption. If possible,
administer the medication at bedtime so the patient can remain in the
supine position for an extended period of time to enhance absorption.

ROUTES 16.2 Basic Concepts,"Inhaled Medications The lungs have a large surface area with an increased amount of blood
flow, so medications are easily absorbed. Medications inhaled from the
mouth into the lungs can be administered using a Metered Dose Inhaler
(MDI), a Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI), or a small-volume nebulizer. A metered
dose inhaler (MDI) provides a mist of medication that is inhaled through
the mouth into the lungs. See Figure 16.5
for an image of an albuterol
MDI. However, during inhalation from an MDI, small medication particles
can get trapped on the tongue or aerosolize into the air and not make it
into the lungs, so a spacer is optimally used for full absorption of
medication.
A DPI is medication provided in a powder form that is inhaled from the
mouth into the lungs using a quick breath to activate the medication and
move it into the lungs from the inhaler. An example of Advair Diskus DPI is
illustrated in Figure 16.6.
Hand-held, small-volume nebulizers provide a fine mist using oxygen or
compressed air to transport the liquid medication from the nebulizer cup
into the mouth and into the lungs as the patient breathes normally. See
Figure 16.7
for an image of medication packaged for use with nebulizers.
Before administering an inhaler, the nurse should perform hand hygiene
and check medication rights as with all medication. If the patient is self-
administering the medication, advise them to wash their hands. The
patientâs respiratory system should be assessed and documented before
and after the administration of inhaled medications, including assessment
When administering an MDI, the nurse should shake the inhaler and add
a spacer onto the mouthpiece. The use of spacers with MDIs is considered
best practice because they help ensure the medication is inhaled rather
than inadvertently placed in the mouth. They also reduce waste by
ensuring the patient receives the full amount of medication. The patient
should be instructed to exhale while placing the spacerâs mouthpiece into
their mouth. The inhaler is depressed to move the aerosolized medication
into the spacer, and the patient should breathe in normally through the
spacer to receive the medication. If a spacer is not available, the patient
should exhale and hold the inhaler mouthpiece about 1 to 2 inches away
from their mouth to help ensure the medication is inhaled via the larynx
and not sprayed onto the posterior pharynx. As the inhaler is depressed,
the patient should inhale the medication deeply through their mouth and
into their lungs. The patient should be advised to hold their breath for 5 to
10 seconds after inhaling the medication and then exhale through pursed
lips. The patient should wait for 1 to 5 minutes between each puff of
medication. When administering inhaled corticosteroids via MDI, the
patient should rinse their mouth with water afterwards to prevent fungal
infection.
When using a DPI, the nurse should load the medication into the devices
as required and then activate the inhaler per the manufacturerâs
guidelines. The patient should be instructed to exhale and then place their
lips around the mouthpiece and inhale strongly and deeply. After they
have inhaled, they should hold their breath for 10 seconds or as long as
comfortable and then exhale through pursed lips. The patient should wait
1 to 5 minutes between puffs of medication. If the DPI contains a
corticosteroid medication, the patient should gargle and rinse with tap
water to decrease the risk of developing a fungal infection.
When using a small-volume nebulizer, the nurse pours the liquid
medication into the medication cup of the nebulizer. When possible, the
enhance deep breaths and absorption of medication. The bottom end of
the tubing is attached to the oxygen flowmeter, and the flow rate should
be set between 6-10 L/minute, based on the manufacturerâs
recommendations. The top end of the tubing is connected to either a
nebulizer mask or mouthpiece. The patient should be instructed to inhale
slowly through the device into their mouth and hold each breath for a
slight pause before exhaling. Remain with the patient during the
nebulizer treatment, which usually takes about 15 minutes. After
treatment, the patient should be encouraged to cough and perform oral
care. The patientâs respiratory system should be reevaluated after the
administration of inhaled medications to document therapeutic effects, as
well as to monitor for adverse effects.
Inhalers should be cleaned after use per the manufacturerâs directions.
Most MDI and DPI inhalers track how much medication is left in the
canister. Patients should be advised to obtain refills of these medications
before the inhaler runs out of doses.

comfortable and then exhale through pursed lips. The patient should wait
1 to 5 minutes between puffs of medication. If the DPI contains a
corticosteroid medication, the patient should gargle and rinse with tap
water to decrease the risk of developing a fungal infection.
When using a small-volume nebulizer, the nurse pours the liquid
medication into the medication cup of the nebulizer. When possible, the
enhance deep breaths and absorption of medication. The bottom end of
the tubing is attached to the oxygen flowmeter, and the flow rate should
be set between 6-10 L/minute, based on the manufacturerâs
recommendations. The top end of the tubing is connected to either a
nebulizer mask or mouthpiece. The patient should be instructed to inhale
slowly through the device into their mouth and hold each breath for a
slight pause before exhaling. Remain with the patient during the
nebulizer treatment, which usually takes about 15 minutes. After
treatment, the patient should be encouraged to cough and perform oral
care. The patientâs respiratory system should be reevaluated after the
administration of inhaled medications to document therapeutic effects, as
well as to monitor for adverse effects.
Inhalers should be cleaned after use per the manufacturerâs directions.
Most MDI and DPI inhalers track how much medication is left in the
canister. Patients should be advised to obtain refills of these medications
before the inhaler runs out of doses.

supplementation and have a functioning gastrointestinal tract, but cannot
swallow food safely. Feedings can be administered via enteral tubes
placed into the stomach or into the small intestine (usually the jejunum).
For example, enteral feeding is commonly used for patients with the
following conditions:
â¢  Impaired swallowing (such as from a stroke or Parkinsonâs disease)
â¢  Decreased level of consciousness
â¢  Respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation
â¢  Oropharyngeal or esophageal obstruction (such as in head or neck

CHAPTER 17 ENTERAL TUBE MANAGEMENT 17.2 Basic Concepts of Enteral Tubes,"Types of Enteral Tubes There are several different types of enteral tubes based on their location in
the gastrointestinal system, as well as their function. Three commonly

An example of a large bore nasogastric tube is the Salem Sump. Large
bore nasogastric tubes, such as the Salem Sump, are used for gastric
decompression. The Salem Sump has a double lumen that includes a
venting system. One lumen is used to empty the stomach, and the other
lumen is used to provide a continuous flow of air. The continuous flow of
air reduces negative pressure and prevents gastric mucosa from being
drawn into the catheter, which causes mucosal damage. This terminal end

is placed in the jejunum of the small intestine for patients who cannot
tolerate the administration of enteral formula or medications into the
stomach due to medical conditions such as delayed gastric emptying. See

CHAPTER 17 ENTERAL TUBE MANAGEMENT 17.2 Basic Concepts of Enteral Tubes,"Assessing Tube Placement Feedings or medications administered into an incorrectly placed enteral
tube result in life-threatening aspiration pneumonia. The placement of an
enteral tube is immediately verified after insertion by an X-ray to ensure it
has not been inadvertently placed into the trachea and down into the
bronchi. See Figure 17.6
for an image of an X-ray demonstrating correct
placement of an enteral tube in the stomach as indicated by the lower red
arrow. (This X-ray also demonstrates an endotracheal tube correctly placed
in the trachea as indicated by the top arrow.)  After X-ray verification, the
tube should be marked with adhesive tape and/or a permanent marker to
indicate the point on the tube where the feeding tube enters the nares or
penetrates the abdominal wall. This number on the tube at the entry
during handoff reports. At the start of every shift, nurses evaluate if the
incremental marking or external tube length has changed. If a change is
observed, bedside tests such as visualization or pH testing of tube aspirate
can help determine if the tube has become dislocated. If in doubt, a
radiograph should be obtained to determine tube location.
After the initial verification of tube placement by X-ray, it is possible for the
tube to migrate out of position due to the patient coughing, vomiting, and
moving. For this reason, the nurse must routinely check tube placement
recommends that the position of a feeding tube should be checked and
documented every four hours and prior to the administration of enteral
feedings and medications by measuring the visible tube length and
comparing it to the length documented during X-ray verification.
Older methods of checking tube placement included observing aspirated
GI contents or the administration of air with a syringe while auscultating
(commonly referred to as the âwhoosh testâ). However, research has
determined these methods are unreliable and should no longer be used
to verify placement.
Checking the pH of aspirated gastric contents is an alternative method to
verify placement that may be used in some agencies. Gastric aspirate
should have a pH of less than or equal to 5.5 using pH indicator paper that
is marked for use with human aspirate. However, caution should be used
with this method because enteral formula and some medications alter the
gastric pH.
Follow agency policy for assessing and documenting tube placement.
Additionally, if the patient develops respiratory symptoms that indicate
potential aspiration, immediately notify the provider and withhold enteral
feedings and medications until the placement is verified.","CHAPTER 17 ENTERAL TUBE MANAGEMENT 17.2 Basic Concepts of Enteral Tubes Assessing Tube Placement Feedings or medications administered into an incorrectly placed enteral

seepage around the insertion point that can cause skin breakdown if not
cleaned regularly. Follow agency policy for cleansing the external insertion
site for PEG and PEJ tubes. Cleansing is typically performed using gauze
moistened with water or saline and then allowed to air dry before the

is prone to breakdown, barrier cream or dressings may be prescribed to
prevent breakdown.","CHAPTER 17 ENTERAL TUBE MANAGEMENT 17.2 Basic Concepts of Enteral Tubes Assessing and Cleaning the Tube Insertion Site The area of tube insertion should be assessed daily for signs of pressure

CHAPTER 17 ENTERAL TUBE MANAGEMENT 17.2 Basic Concepts of Enteral Tubes,"Tube Feeding Enteral Nutrition (EN) refers to nutrition provided directly into the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract through an enteral tube that bypasses the oral
cavity. Each year in the United States, over 250,000 hospitalized patients
from infants to older adults receive EN. It is also used widely in
rehabilitation, longâterm care, and home settings. EN requires a
multidisciplinary team approach, including a registered dietician, health
performs a nutrition assessment and determines what type of enteral
nutrition is appropriate to promote improved patient outcomes. The
health care provider writes the order for the enteral nutrition. Prescriptions
for enteral nutrition should be reviewed by the nurse for the following
components: type of enteral nutrition formula, amount and frequency of
free water flushes, route of administration, administration method, and
rate. Any concerns about the components of the prescription should be
verified with the provider before tube feeding is administered.
Tube feeding can be administered using gravity to provide a bolus feeding
or via a pump to provide continuous or intermittent feeding. Feedings via
a pump are set up in mL/hr, with the rate prescribed by the health care
provider. See Figure 17.7
for an image of an enteral tube feeding pump
and the associated tubing. Note that tubing used for enteral feeding is
indicated by specific colors (such as purple in Figure 17.7). A global safety
initiative, referred to as âEnFit,â is in progress to ensure all devices used
with enteral feeding, such as extension sets, syringes, PEG tubes, and NG
tubes have specific EnFit ends that can only be used with tube feeding
sets. This new safety design will avoid inadvertent administration of
enteral feeding into intravenous tubing that can cause life-threatening
adverse effects.
Review the âChecklist for NG Tube Enteral Feeding by Gravity withIrrigationâ section for additional information regarding administering
bolus feedings by gravity.
Life Span Considerations
Enteral feeding is administered to infants and children via a syringe,
gravity feeding set, or feeding pump. The method selected is dependenton the nature of the feeding and clinical status of the child.
Complications of Enteral Feeding
The most serious complication of enteral feeding is inadvertent respiratory
aspiration of gastric contents, causing life-threatening aspiration
pneumonia. Other complications include tube clogging, tubing
misconnections, and patient intolerance of enteral feeding.
REDUCING RISK OF ASPIRATIONIn addition to verifying tube placement as discussed in an earlier section,
nurses perform additional interventions to prevent aspiration. The
American Association of CriticalâCare Nurses recommends the following
guidelines to reduce the risk for aspiration:
â¢  Maintain the head of the bed at 30Â°-45Â° unless contraindicated
â¢  Use sedatives as sparingly as possible
â¢  Assess feeding tube placement at fourâhour intervals
â¢  Observe for change in the amount of external length of the tube
â¢  Assess for gastrointestinal intolerance at fourâhour intervals
Measurement of gastric residual volume (GRV) is performed by using a
60-mL syringe to aspirate stomach contents through the tube. It has
traditionally been used to assess aspiration risk with associated
interventions such as slowing or stopping the enteral feeding. GRVs in the
range of 200â500 mL cause interventions such as slowing or stopping the
feeding to reduce risk of aspiration. However, according to recent research,
it is not appropriate to stop enteral nutrition for GRVs less than 500 mL in
the absence of other signs of intolerance because of the impact on thepatientâs overall nutritional status. Additionally, the aspiration of gastric
residual volumes can contribute to tube clogging.
Follow agency policy
regarding measuring gastric residual volume and implementing
interventions to prevent aspiration.
MANAGING TUBE CLOGGINGFeeding tubes are prone to clogging for a variety of reasons. The risk of
clogging may result from tube properties (such as narrow tube diameter),
the tube tip location (stomach vs. small intestine), insufficient water
flushes, aspiration for gastric residual volume (GRV), contaminated
formula, and incorrect medication preparation and administration. A
clogged feeding tube can result in decreased nutrient delivery or delayed
administration of medication, and, if not corrected, the patient may
require additional surgical intervention to replace the tube.
Research supports using water as the best choice for initial declogging
efforts. Instill warm water into the tube using a 60âmL syringe, and apply a
gentle backâandâforth motion with the plunger of the syringe. Research
shows that the use of cranberry juice and carbonated beverages to flush
the tube can worsen tube occlusions because the acidic pH of these fluids
can cause proteins in the enteral formula to precipitate within the tube. If
water does not work, a pancreatic enzyme solution, an enzymatic
declogging kit, or mechanical devices for clearing feeding tubes are the
best secondâline options.
To prevent enteral tubes from clogging, it is important to follow these
guidelines:
â¢  Flush feeding tubes at a minimum of once a shift.
â¢  Flush feeding tubes immediately before and after intermittent
feedings. During continuous feedings, flush at standardized,
scheduled intervals.
â¢  Flush feeding tubes before and after medication administration and
follow appropriate medication administration practices.
â¢  Limit gastric residual volume checks because the acidic gastric
contents may cause protein in enteral formulas to precipitate within
the lumen of the tube.
PREVENTING TUBING MISCONNECTIONSIn April 2006, The Joint Commission issued a Sentinel Event Alert on
tubing misconnections due to enteral feedings being inadvertently
infused into intravenous lines with life-threatening results. A color-coded
enteral tubing connection design was developed to visually communicate
the difference between enteral tubing and intravenous tubing. In addition
to tubing design, follow these guidelines to prevent tubing misconnection
errors:
â¢  Make tubing connections under proper lighting.â¢  Do not modify or adapt IV or feeding devices because doing so may
compromise the safety features incorporated into their design.
â¢  When making a reconnection, routinely trace lines back to their
origins and then ensure that they are secure.
â¢  As part of a handâoff process, recheck connections and trace all tubes
back to their origins.
MANAGING INTOLERANCES AND IMBALANCESPatients should be monitored daily for signs of tube feeding intolerance,
such as abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, and
constipation. If cramping occurs during bolus feedings, it can be helpful to
administer the enteral nutritional formula at room temperature to prevent
symptoms.
Notify the provider of signs of intolerance with anticipated
changes in the prescription regarding the type of formula or the rate of
administration. Electrolytes and blood glucose levels should also be
monitored, as ordered, for signs of imbalances.","CHAPTER 17 ENTERAL TUBE MANAGEMENT 17.2 Basic Concepts of Enteral Tubes Tube Feeding Enteral Nutrition (EN) refers to nutrition provided directly into the

PREVENTING TUBING MISCONNECTIONSIn April 2006, The Joint Commission issued a Sentinel Event Alert on
tubing misconnections due to enteral feedings being inadvertently
infused into intravenous lines with life-threatening results. A color-coded
enteral tubing connection design was developed to visually communicate
the difference between enteral tubing and intravenous tubing. In addition
to tubing design, follow these guidelines to prevent tubing misconnection
errors:
â¢  Make tubing connections under proper lighting.â¢  Do not modify or adapt IV or feeding devices because doing so may
compromise the safety features incorporated into their design.
â¢  When making a reconnection, routinely trace lines back to their
origins and then ensure that they are secure.
â¢  As part of a handâoff process, recheck connections and trace all tubes
back to their origins.
MANAGING INTOLERANCES AND IMBALANCESPatients should be monitored daily for signs of tube feeding intolerance,
such as abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, and
constipation. If cramping occurs during bolus feedings, it can be helpful to
administer the enteral nutritional formula at room temperature to prevent
symptoms.
Notify the provider of signs of intolerance with anticipated
changes in the prescription regarding the type of formula or the rate of
administration. Electrolytes and blood glucose levels should also be
monitored, as ordered, for signs of imbalances.",1667
CHAPTER 17 ENTERAL TUBE MANAGEMENT 17.2 Basic Concepts of Enteral Tubes,"Tube Irrigation Enteral tubes are routinely flushed to maintain patency. Follow agency
policy when flushing a tube. Typically, tap water and a 60-mL syringe are
used to flush enteral tubes.

CHAPTER 17 ENTERAL TUBE MANAGEMENT 17.2 Basic Concepts of Enteral Tubes,"Tube Suctioning NG tubes may be used to remove gastric content, referred to as gastric
decompression. In these situations, the stomach is drained by gravity or by
connection to a suction pump to prevent nausea, vomiting, gastric
distension, or to wash the stomach of toxins. This procedure is commonly
used for post-operative patients who have not yet regained peristalsis or
for patients with a small bowel obstruction to remove the accumulation of
stomach bile. It is also used in the emergency department for patients
with some types of poisonings or overdoses and is commonly referred to
as âpumping out the stomach.â
For patients receiving suctioning via enteral tubes, the drainage amount

CHAPTER 18 ADMINISTRATION OF PARENTERAL MEDICATIONS 18.1 Administration of Parenteral Medications Introduction,"Learning Objectives â¢  Safely administer medication via the intradermal,
subcutaneous, and intramuscular routes

â¢  Select appropriate equipment
â¢  Calculate correct amount of medication to administer
â¢  Correctly select site using anatomical landmarks
â¢  Modify procedure to reflect variations across the life span
â¢  Document actions and observations
â¢  Recognize and report significant deviations from norms
Administering medication by the parenteral route is defined as
medications placed into the tissues and the circulatory system by
injection. There are several reasons why medications may be prescribed
via the parenteral route. Medications administered parenterally areabsorbed more quickly compared to oral ingestion, meaning they have a
faster onset of action. Because they do not undergo digestive processes in
the gastrointestinal tract, they are metabolized differently, resulting in a
stronger effect than oral medications. The parenteral route may also be
prescribed when patients are nauseated or unable to swallow.
Although an injectable medication has many benefits, there are
additional safety precautions the nurse must take during administration
because an injection is considered an invasive procedure. Injections cause
a break in the protective barrier of the skin, and some are administered
directly into the bloodstream so there is increased risk of infection and
rapid development of life-threatening adverse reactions.
There are four potential routes of parenteral injections, including
intradermal (IM), subcutaneous (SQ), intramuscular (IM), and intravenous
(IV). An intradermal injection is administered in the dermis just below the
epidermis. A subcutaneous injection is administered into adipose tissue
under the dermis. An intramuscular injection is administered into a
muscle. Intravenous medications are injected directly into the
bloodstream. Administering medication via the intravenous (IV) route is
discussed in the âIV Therapy Managementâ chapter. This chapter will
describe several evidence-based guidelines for safe administration of

CHAPTER 18 ADMINISTRATION OF PARENTERAL MEDICATIONS 18.2 Basic Concepts,"Syringes Syringes are used to administer parenteral medications. A disposable
syringe is a sterile device that is available in various sizes ranging from 0.5
mL to 60 mL. A syringe consists of a plunger, a barrel, and a needle hub.
Syringes may be supplied individually or with a needle and protective
cover attached. See Figure 18.1
for an illustration of the parts of a syringe.
Luer lock syringes have threads in the needle hub that provide a secure
for anconnection of needles, tubing, or other devices. See Figure 18.2
image of a Luer lock syringe with a barrel and a readable scale. This image
shows a syringe that holds 12 cc, also referred to as 12 mL. When
withdrawing medication, match up the top of the plunger and the line on
the barrel scale with the amount of medication you need to administer. In
this image, 3 mL of medication is contained in the syringe.
Video Review of How to Read a Syringe
Insulin is administered using a specific insulin syringe. Insulin syringes are
marked in units, not milliliters (mL), because insulin is prescribed by
providers in units, not mLs. A regular syringe marked in milliliters should
never be used to administer insulin. All insulin syringes have orange caps
for quick identification, but verify the markings are in units to prevent a
medication error. See Figure 18.3

CHAPTER 18 ADMINISTRATION OF PARENTERAL MEDICATIONS 18.2 Basic Concepts,"Needles Needles are made out of stainless steel. They are sterile and disposable
hub, shaft, and bevel. The hub fits onto the tip of the syringe. All three
parts must remain sterile at all times. The bevel is the tip of the needle
that is slanted to create a slit into the skin. See Figure 18.4
for an image of
a bevel.
Gauge and Length
The gauge of a needle refers to its diameter. Needles range in various
sized gauges from small diameter (25 to 29 gauge) to large diameter (18 to
22 gauge). Note that the larger the diameter of a needle, the smaller the
gauge number. Larger diameter needles (18-22 gauge) are typically used
to administer thicker medications or blood products. See Figure 18.5
for
an image comparing various needle lengths and gauges. Read more
about needle gauges according to type of injection in Table 18.2 in the
Gauge and length are marked on the outer packaging of needles. Needle
length varies from 1/8 inches to 3 inches and is selected based on the type
of injection. Nurses select the appropriate gauge and length according to
the medication ordered, the anatomical location selected, and the
patientâs body mass and age. For example, an intramuscular injection
requires a longer needle to reach muscle tissue than an intradermal
injection that is inserted just under the epidermis. Read more about
needle length according to type of injection in Table 18.2 in the âAnatomic
Locationâ section.
Many needles have safety shields attached to prevent needlestick injuries.
See Figure 18.6
for an image of a syringe inserted into a vial of medication
with a needle and a type of safety shield attached.
Needle Insertion Angle and Removal
When administering an injection, the syringe should be held like a dart to
prevent inadvertent release of medication as the needle is inserted. The
needle should be inserted at the proper angle depending on the type of
injection. See Table 18.2 for additional details regarding angles of insertion
for each type of injection.  The needle should be inserted all the way to the
hub smoothly and quickly to reduce discomfort of the injection. See
Figure 18.7
for an illustration of angles of insertion for each type of
injection. After the needle is inserted, it is important to hold the syringe
steady to prevent tissue damage. The needle should be removed at the
same angle used for insertion.
Anatomical Location
It is important for the nurse to select the correct anatomical location for
parenteral medication administration according to the type of injection
prescribed and for optimal absorption of the medications. Injection of
medication into the correct location also prevents injury to the tissues,
nerves, blood vessels, and bones. Table 18.2 summarizes anatomical
locations, needle sizes, amount of fluid, and the degree of angle of the
needle insertion for each type of parenteral injection with life span and
other considerations provided. Additional details regarding each type of
injection are discussed later in this chapter.

CHAPTER 18 ADMINISTRATION OF PARENTERAL MEDICATIONS 18.2 Basic Concepts,"Preparing Medications Ampules
Parenteral medications are supplied in sterile vials, ampules, and prefilled
syringes. Ampules are small glass containers containing liquid medication
ranging from 1 mL to 10 mL sizes. They have a scored neck to indicate
where to break the ampule. See Figure 18.8
for an image of an ampule of
epinephrine.
Medication is withdrawn from an ampule using a syringe with a special
needle called a blunt fill filter needle. These needles have a blunt end to
prevent needlestick injuries and a filter to prevent glass particles from
being drawn up into the syringe. See Figure 18.9
for an image of a blunt
fill filter needle. Filter needles should never be used to inject medication
into a patient. The filter needle should be removed and replaced with a
needle appropriate in size and gauge for the type of injection and the
anatomical location of the patient.
When breaking open an ampule, it is important to use appropriate steps
to avoid injury. First, tap the ampule while holding it upright to move fluid
down out of the neck. Place a piece of gauze around the neck, and then
snap the neck away from your hands. See Figure 18.10
for an illustration
of how to safely open an ampule.

Vials
A vial is a single- or multi-dose plastic container with a rubber seal top.
Most rubber seals are covered by a plastic cap. See Figure 18.11
for an
image of a medication dispensed in a vial. A single-use vial must be
discarded after one use. Multi-dose vials are used for medications like
insulin and must be labelled with the date it was opened. Refer to agency
policy regarding how long an open vial may be used and how it should be
stored. For example, insulin is typically refrigerated until the vial is opened,and then it can be stored at room temperature for 28 days.
A vial is a closed system. Air must be injected prior to medication
withdrawal to maintain a pressure gradient so that solution can be
removed from the vial. It is also important to closely observe and maintain
the tip of the needle within the level of medication inside the vial as it is
removed. See Figure 18.12
for an image of removing medication from a
vial.
To remove medication from a vial, pull air into the syringe to match theamount of medication you plan to remove. Hold the syringe like a pencil
and insert the needle into the rubber stopper on the top of the vial. Push
the plunger down until all of the air is in the bottle. This helps to keep the
right amount of pressure in the bottle and makes it easier to draw up the
medication. With the needle still in the vial, turn the bottle and syringe
upside down (vial above syringe). Pull the plunger to fill the syringe to the
desired amount. Check the syringe for air bubbles. If you see any large
bubbles, push the plunger until the air is purged out of the syringe. Pull
the plunger back down to the desired dose. Remove the needle from the
bottle. Be careful to not let the needle touch anything until you are ready
to inject.

CHAPTER 18 ADMINISTRATION OF PARENTERAL MEDICATIONS 18.3 Evidence-Based Practices for Injections,"Preventing Infection Administering parenteral medications is considered an invasive
procedure. It is imperative to take additional measures when
administering parenteral medications to prevent health care associated
infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides several
recommendations for safe injection practices to prevent contamination
and spread of pathogens. These recommendations include hand hygiene,
prevention of needle/syringe contamination, preparation of the patientâs
skin, prevention of contamination of the solution, and use of new, sterile
equipment for each injection.
Each of these recommendations is
discussed below.
Perform Hand Hygiene
Always perform hand hygiene before preparing and after administering
the injection with facility-approved, alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Seemore information about performing effective hand hygiene in the âAsepticTechniqueâ chapter.
Prevent Needle/Syringe Contamination
Keep the parts of the needle and syringe sterile. Keep the tip of the
syringe sterile and keep it covered with a cap or needle. Avoid letting the
needle touch unsterile surfaces, such as the outer edges of the ampule or
vial, the surface of the needle cap, or the counter. Always keep the needle
plunger.
After administration, use the scoop-cap method to recap the needle to
avoid needlestick injuries and place the used syringe/needle immediately
in the sharps container.
Video Review of Scoop-Cap Technique
Prepare Patientâs Skin
Wash the patientâs skin with soap and water if it is soiled. Follow agency
policy for skin preparation. When using an alcohol swab, use a circular
motion to rub the area for 15 seconds, and then let the area dry for 30
seconds. If cleaning a site, move from the center of the site outward in a
5-cm (2 in.) radius.
Prevent Contamination of Solution
Use single-dose vials or ampules whenever possible. Do not keep multi-
dose vials in patient treatment areas. Discard a container if sterility is
compromised or questionable. Medications from ampules should be used
immediately and then discarded appropriately. Additional information
about ampules is provided in the âBasic Conceptsâ section.
Use New Sterile Equipment
Use a new, sterile syringe and needle with each patient. Inspect packaging
for intactness and discard if there are rips or torn corners. If single-use
equipment is not available, use syringes and needles designed for steam
sterilization.","CHAPTER 18 ADMINISTRATION OF PARENTERAL MEDICATIONS 18.3 Evidence-Based Practices for Injections Preventing Infection Administering parenteral medications is considered an invasive

CHAPTER 18 ADMINISTRATION OF PARENTERAL MEDICATIONS 18.3 Evidence-Based Practices for Injections,"Injections With proper preparation and technique, injections can be given safely and
effectively to patients to prevent harm. It is essential to use correct needle
sizes and angles of insertion and select appropriate anatomical locations
based on patient age, size, and type of injection to avoid complications.
For example, for intramuscular injections the ventrogluteal site is
preferred in adults because it has the greatest muscle thickness, is free of
nerves and blood vessels, and has a small layer of fat, resulting in less
painful administration and optimal absorption of the medication.
Use the correct needle length according to the type of injection to ensure
delivery of medication into the correct layer of tissue and to reducecomplications such as abscesses, pain, and bruising. Needle selection
should be based on the patientâs size, gender, and injection site. Be aware
that women tend to have more adipose tissue around the buttocks and
deltoid fat pad, which means a longer needle is required. Larger diameter
(smaller gauge) needles have been found to reduce pain, swelling, and
redness after an injection because less pressure is required to depress the
plunger.
Removing medication residue on the tip of the needle has been shown to
reduce pain and discomfort of the injection. To remove residue from the
needle, change needles after medication is removed from a vial and
before it is administered to the patient. Additionally, place the bevel side of
the needle up on the patientâs skin for quick and smooth injection of the
needle into the tissue.
Proper positioning of the patient will facilitate proper landmarking of the
site and may reduce perception of pain from the injection. Position the
patientâs limbs in a relaxed, comfortable position to reduce muscle
tension. For example, when giving an intramuscular injection in the
deltoid, have the patient relax their arm by placing their hand in their lap.
The nurse can also encourage relaxation techniques to help decrease the
patientâs anxiety-heightened pain. For example, divert the patientâs
attention away from the injection procedure by chatting about other
topics.","CHAPTER 18 ADMINISTRATION OF PARENTERAL MEDICATIONS 18.3 Evidence-Based Practices for Injections Injections With proper preparation and technique, injections can be given safely and

prevents introducing alcohol into the tissue, which can be irritating and
uncomfortable.

for an image of a tuberculin syringe. Remove theSee Figure 18.16
cap from the needle by pulling it off in a straight motion. A straight
motion helps prevent needlestick injury.
The dosage of an intradermal injection is usually under 0.5 mL, and the
angle of administration for an ID injection is 5 to 15 degrees. Using yournondominant hand, spread the skin taut over the injection site. Taut skin
provides easy entrance for the needle and is also important to do for older
adults, whose skin is less elastic. See Figure 18.17
of an image of a nurse
holding the skin taut prior to injection.
Hold the syringe in the dominant hand between the thumb and
forefinger, with the bevel of the needle up at a 5- to 15-degree angle at the
selected site. Place the needle almost flat against the patientâs skin, bevel
side up, and insert the needle into the skin. Keeping the bevel side up
allows for smooth piercing of the skin and induction of the medication
into the dermis. Advance the needle no more than an eighth of an inch to
nondominant hand to push on the plunger to slowly inject the
medication.
See Figure 18.18

After the ID injection is completed, a bleb (small blister) should appear
under the skin. The presence of the bleb indicates that the medication has
been correctly placed in the dermis. See Figure 18.19
for an image of a
bleb.
Carefully withdraw the needle out of the insertion site using the same
angle it was placed so as not to disturb the bleb. Withdrawing at the same
angle as insertion also minimizes discomfort to the patient and damage
to the tissue. Do not massage or cover the site. Massaging the area may
spread the solution to the underlying subcutaneous tissue. Discard the

CHAPTER 18 ADMINISTRATION OF PARENTERAL MEDICATIONS 18.5 Administering Subcutaneous Medications,"Insulin Injections Insulin is considered a high-alert medication requiring special care to
prevent medication errors.  Care must be taken to ensure the correct type
and amount of insulin are administered at the correct time. It is highly
recommended to have insulin dosages double-checked by another nurse
before administration because of the potential for life-threatening adverse
effects that can occur due to medication errors. Some agencies require
this second safety check.
Only insulin syringes should be used to administer insulin injection. Insulin
syringes are supplied in 30-, 50-, or 100-unit measurements, so read the
barrel increments (calibration) carefully. Insulin is always ordered and
administered in unit dosage. Insulin dosage may be based on the patientâs
pre-meal blood sugar reading and a sliding scale protocol that indicates
the number of units administered based on the blood sugar reading.
There are rapid-, short-, intermediate-, and long-acting insulins. For each
type of insulin, it is important to know the onset, peak, and duration of the
insulin so that it can be timed appropriately with the patientâs food intake.
It is essential to time the administration of insulin with food intake to avoid
hypoglycemia. When administering insulin before a meal, always ensure
the patient is not nauseated and is able to eat. Short- or rapid-acting
insulin may be administered up to 15-30 minutes before meals.
Intermediate insulin is typically administered twice daily, at breakfast anddinner, and long-acting insulin is typically administered in the evening.
When administering cloudy insulin preparations such as NPH insulin
(Humulin-N), gently roll the vial between the palms of your hands to15,16 See
resuspend the medication before withdrawing it from the vial.Figure 18.25
for an image of insulin NPH that is cloudy in color.
Preparing Insulin in a Syringe
When withdrawing insulin from a vial, check the insulin vial to make sure
it is the right kind of insulin and that there are no clumps or particles in it.Also, make sure the insulin is not past its expiration date. Pull air into the
syringe to match the amount of insulin you plan to remove. Hold the
syringe like a pencil and insert the needle into the rubber stopper on the
top of the vial. Push the plunger down until all of the air is in the bottle.
This helps to keep the right amount of pressure in the bottle and makes it
easier to draw up the insulin. With the needle still in the vial, turn the
bottle and syringe upside down (vial above syringe). Pull the plunger to fill
the syringe to the desired amount. Check the syringe for air bubbles. If you
see any large bubbles, push the plunger until the air is purged out of the
syringe. Pull the plunger back down to the desired dose. Remove the
needle from the bottle. Be careful to not let the needle touch anything
until you are ready to inject.
Mixing Two Types of Insulin
If a patient is ordered two types of insulin, some insulins may be mixed
together in one syringe. For example, insulin NPH (Novolin-N) can be
mixed with insulin regular (Humulin-R), insulin aspart (Novolog), or insulin
lispro (Humalog). However, some types of insulin cannot be mixed with
other insulin, such as insulin glargine (Lantus) or insulin detemir
(Levemir).
When mixing insulin, gather your insulin supplies. Check the insulin vials
to make sure they are the right kinds of insulin, there are no clumps or
particles in them, and the expiration dates have not passed. Gently mix
intermediate or premixed insulin by turning the vial on its side and rolling
it between the palms of your hands. Prepare the insulin vials by injecting
air into the intermediate insulin vial. Remove the cap from the needle.With the vial of insulin below the syringe, inject an amount of air equal to
the dose of intermediate insulin that you will be taking. Do not draw out
the insulin into the syringe yet. Remove the needle from the vial. Inject air
into the rapid-acting insulin vial equal to the rapid-acting insulin dose.
With the needle still in the vial, turn the vial upside down (vial above the
syringe) and pull the plunger to fill the syringe with the desired dose.
Check the syringe for air bubbles. If you see any large bubbles, push the
plunger until the air is purged out of the syringe. Pull the plunger back
down to the desired dose. Remove the needle from the vial and recheck
your dose. Insert the needle into the vial of cloudy insulin. Turn the vial
upside down (vial above syringe) and pull the plunger to draw the dose of
intermediate-acting insulin. Because the short-acting insulin is already in
the syringe, pull the plunger to the total number of units you need. Do not
inject any of the insulin back into the vial because the syringe now
contains a mixture of intermediate- and rapid-acting insulin. Remove the
needle from the vial and be careful to not let the needle touch anything
until you are ready to inject.
When mixing insulin, it is important to always draw up the short-acting
insulin first to prevent it from being contaminated with the long-acting
insulin. See Figure 18.26
for an illustration of the order to follow when
mixing insulin.
One anatomic region should be selected for a patientâs insulin injections
to maintain consistent absorption, and then sites should be rotated within
that region. The abdomen absorbs insulin the fastest, followed by the
arms, thighs, and buttocks. It is no longer necessary to rotate anatomic
regions, as was once done, because newer insulins have a lower risk for
causing hypertrophy of the skin.
Video Review of Mixing Insulin:
Insulin Pens
Insulin pens are a newer technology designed to be used multiple times
for a single person, using a new needle for each injection. See Figure
18.27
for an image of an insulin pen. Insulin pens must never be used for
more than one person. Regurgitation of blood into the insulin cartridge
can occur after injection, creating a risk of blood-borne pathogen
transmission if the pen is used for more than one person, even when the
needle is changed.
Prefilled insulin pens consist of a prefilled cartridge of
insulin to which a special, single-use needle is attached. When using an
insulin pen for subcutaneous insulin administration, a few additional steps
must be taken according to manufacturer guidelines. The needle should
be primed with two units of insulin, and then the dosage should be dialed
in the dose window. The pen should be held with the hand using four
fingers so that the thumb can be used to fully depress the plunger button.
The pen should be left in place for ten seconds after the insulin is injected
to aid in absorption.
Insulin pens are often prescribed for home use because of their ease of
use. Patients and family members must be educated on how to correctly
use an insulin pen before discharge. To evaluate a patientâs knowledge of
how to correctly administer insulin, ask them to âreturn demonstrateâ the
procedure to you.
Special Considerations for Insulin
â¢  Insulin vials are stored in the refrigerator until they are opened. When
removed, it should be labelled with an open date and expiration date
according to agency policy. When a vial is in use, it should be at room
temperature. Do not inject cold insulin because this can causediscomfort.
â¢  Patients who take insulin should monitor their blood sugar (glucose)
levels as prescribed by their health care provider.
â¢  Vials of insulin should be inspected prior to use. Any change in
appearance may indicate a change in potency. Check the expiration
date and do not use it if it has expired.
â¢  All health care workers should be aware of the signs and symptoms of
hypoglycemia. Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include fruity
breath, restlessness, agitation, confusion, slurring of words, clammy
skin, inability to concentrate or follow commands, hunger, and nausea.
Follow agency policy regarding hypoglycemic reactions.

the patient is not nauseated and is able to eat. Short- or rapid-acting
insulin may be administered up to 15-30 minutes before meals.
Intermediate insulin is typically administered twice daily, at breakfast anddinner, and long-acting insulin is typically administered in the evening.
When administering cloudy insulin preparations such as NPH insulin
(Humulin-N), gently roll the vial between the palms of your hands to15,16 See
resuspend the medication before withdrawing it from the vial.Figure 18.25
for an image of insulin NPH that is cloudy in color.
Preparing Insulin in a Syringe
When withdrawing insulin from a vial, check the insulin vial to make sure
it is the right kind of insulin and that there are no clumps or particles in it.Also, make sure the insulin is not past its expiration date. Pull air into the
syringe to match the amount of insulin you plan to remove. Hold the
syringe like a pencil and insert the needle into the rubber stopper on the
top of the vial. Push the plunger down until all of the air is in the bottle.
This helps to keep the right amount of pressure in the bottle and makes it
easier to draw up the insulin. With the needle still in the vial, turn the
bottle and syringe upside down (vial above syringe). Pull the plunger to fill
the syringe to the desired amount. Check the syringe for air bubbles. If you
see any large bubbles, push the plunger until the air is purged out of the
syringe. Pull the plunger back down to the desired dose. Remove the
needle from the bottle. Be careful to not let the needle touch anything
until you are ready to inject.
Mixing Two Types of Insulin
If a patient is ordered two types of insulin, some insulins may be mixed
together in one syringe. For example, insulin NPH (Novolin-N) can be
mixed with insulin regular (Humulin-R), insulin aspart (Novolog), or insulin
lispro (Humalog). However, some types of insulin cannot be mixed with
other insulin, such as insulin glargine (Lantus) or insulin detemir
(Levemir).
When mixing insulin, gather your insulin supplies. Check the insulin vials
to make sure they are the right kinds of insulin, there are no clumps or
particles in them, and the expiration dates have not passed. Gently mix
intermediate or premixed insulin by turning the vial on its side and rolling
it between the palms of your hands. Prepare the insulin vials by injecting
air into the intermediate insulin vial. Remove the cap from the needle.With the vial of insulin below the syringe, inject an amount of air equal to
the dose of intermediate insulin that you will be taking. Do not draw out
the insulin into the syringe yet. Remove the needle from the vial. Inject air
into the rapid-acting insulin vial equal to the rapid-acting insulin dose.
With the needle still in the vial, turn the vial upside down (vial above the
syringe) and pull the plunger to fill the syringe with the desired dose.
Check the syringe for air bubbles. If you see any large bubbles, push the
plunger until the air is purged out of the syringe. Pull the plunger back
down to the desired dose. Remove the needle from the vial and recheck
your dose. Insert the needle into the vial of cloudy insulin. Turn the vial
upside down (vial above syringe) and pull the plunger to draw the dose of
intermediate-acting insulin. Because the short-acting insulin is already in
the syringe, pull the plunger to the total number of units you need. Do not
inject any of the insulin back into the vial because the syringe now
contains a mixture of intermediate- and rapid-acting insulin. Remove the
needle from the vial and be careful to not let the needle touch anything
until you are ready to inject.
When mixing insulin, it is important to always draw up the short-acting
insulin first to prevent it from being contaminated with the long-acting
insulin. See Figure 18.26
for an illustration of the order to follow when
mixing insulin.
One anatomic region should be selected for a patientâs insulin injections
to maintain consistent absorption, and then sites should be rotated within
that region. The abdomen absorbs insulin the fastest, followed by the
arms, thighs, and buttocks. It is no longer necessary to rotate anatomic
regions, as was once done, because newer insulins have a lower risk for
causing hypertrophy of the skin.
Video Review of Mixing Insulin:
Insulin Pens
Insulin pens are a newer technology designed to be used multiple times
for a single person, using a new needle for each injection. See Figure
18.27
for an image of an insulin pen. Insulin pens must never be used for
more than one person. Regurgitation of blood into the insulin cartridge
can occur after injection, creating a risk of blood-borne pathogen
transmission if the pen is used for more than one person, even when the
needle is changed.
Prefilled insulin pens consist of a prefilled cartridge of
insulin to which a special, single-use needle is attached. When using an
insulin pen for subcutaneous insulin administration, a few additional steps
must be taken according to manufacturer guidelines. The needle should
be primed with two units of insulin, and then the dosage should be dialed
in the dose window. The pen should be held with the hand using four
fingers so that the thumb can be used to fully depress the plunger button.
The pen should be left in place for ten seconds after the insulin is injected
to aid in absorption.
Insulin pens are often prescribed for home use because of their ease of
use. Patients and family members must be educated on how to correctly
use an insulin pen before discharge. To evaluate a patientâs knowledge of
how to correctly administer insulin, ask them to âreturn demonstrateâ the
procedure to you.
Special Considerations for Insulin
â¢  Insulin vials are stored in the refrigerator until they are opened. When
removed, it should be labelled with an open date and expiration date
according to agency policy. When a vial is in use, it should be at room
temperature. Do not inject cold insulin because this can causediscomfort.
â¢  Patients who take insulin should monitor their blood sugar (glucose)
levels as prescribed by their health care provider.
â¢  Vials of insulin should be inspected prior to use. Any change in
appearance may indicate a change in potency. Check the expiration
date and do not use it if it has expired.
â¢  All health care workers should be aware of the signs and symptoms of
hypoglycemia. Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include fruity
breath, restlessness, agitation, confusion, slurring of words, clammy
skin, inability to concentrate or follow commands, hunger, and nausea.
Follow agency policy regarding hypoglycemic reactions.

CHAPTER 18 ADMINISTRATION OF PARENTERAL MEDICATIONS 18.5 Administering Subcutaneous Medications,"Device Technology A jet injector is a medical device used for vaccinations and other
subcutaneous injections that uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid
to penetrate the skin instead of a hypodermic needle. An example of a flu
vaccine approved for administration to adults aged 18-64 is AFLURIA
Â© Quadrivalent. The most common injection-site adverse reactions of the
jet injector flu vaccine up to seven days post-vaccination were tenderness,
swelling, pain, redness, itching, and bruising.
Insulin can also be
successfully administered via a jet injector, with research demonstrating
improved glucose control because the insulin is spread out over a larger
area of tissue and enters the bloodstream faster than when administered
by an insulin pen or needle.  Patients have indicated preference for insulin
delivered by the jet injector compared to the insulin pen or syringe
because it is needle-free with less tissue injury and pain as compared to
the needle injection.
See Figure 18.29
for an image comparing insulin
delivery devices.
Another type of new technology used to continuously deliver
subcutaneous insulin is the insulin pump. Pumps are a computerized
device attached to the body, either with tubing or attached to the skin.
They are programmed to release small doses of insulin (continuously or as
a surge bolus dose) close to mealtime to control the rise in blood sugar
after a meal. They work by closely mimicking the bodyâs normal release of
insulin. Insulin doses are delivered through a flexible plastic tube called a
catheter. With the aid of a small needle, the catheter is inserted through
the skin into the fatty tissue and is taped in place.

CHAPTER 18 ADMINISTRATION OF PARENTERAL MEDICATIONS 18.6 Administering Intramuscular Medications,"Anatomic Sites Anatomic sites must be selected carefully for intramuscular injections andinclude the ventrogluteal, vastus lateralis, and the deltoid. The vastus
lateralis site is preferred for infants because that muscle is most
developed. The ventrogluteal site is generally recommended for IM
medication administration in adults, but IM vaccines may be administered
in the deltoid site. Additional information regarding injections in each of
these sites is provided in the following subsections.
Ventrogluteal
This site involves the gluteus medius and minimus muscle and is the
safest injection site for adults and children because it provides the
greatest thickness of gluteal muscles, is free from penetrating nerves and
blood vessels, and has a thin layer of fat. To locate the ventrogluteal site,
place the patient in a supine or lateral position. Use your right hand for the
left hip or your left hand for the right hip. Place the heel or palm of your
hand on the greater trochanter, with the thumb pointed toward the belly
button. Extend your index finger to the anterior superior iliac spine and
spread your middle finger pointing towards the iliac crest. Insert the
needle into the âVâ formed between your index and middle fingers. This is
the preferred site for all oily and irritating solutions for patients of any age.
for an image demonstrating how to accurately locate theSee Figure 18.31
ventrogluteal site using your hand.
The needle gauge used at the ventrogluteal site is determined by the
solution of the medication ordered. An aqueous solution can be given
with a 20- to 25-gauge needle, whereas viscous or oil-based solutions are
given with 18- to 21-gauge needles. The needle length is based on patient
weight and body mass index. A thin adult may require a 5/8-inch to 1-inch
(16 mm to 25 mm) needle, while an average adult may require a 1-inch (25
mm) needle, and a larger adult (over 70 kg) may require a 1-inch to 1Â½-
needles. Refer to  agency policies regarding needle length for infants,
children, and adolescents. Up to 3 mL of medication may be administered
in the ventrogluteal muscle of an average adult and up to 1 mL in children.
for an image of locating the ventrogluteal site on aSee Figure 18.32
patient.
Vastus Lateralis
The vastus lateralis site is commonly used for immunizations in infants
and toddlers because the muscle is thick and well-developed. This muscle
is located on the anterior lateral aspect of the thigh and extends from one
handâs breadth above the knee to one handâs breadth below the greater
trochanter. The outer middle third of the muscle is used for injections. To
help relax the patient, ask the patient to lie flat with knees slightly bent or
have the patient in a sitting position. See Figure 18.33
for an image of the
vastus lateralis injection site.
The length of the needle used at the vastus lateralis site is based on the
patientâs age, weight, and body mass index. In general, the recommended
needle length for an adult is 1 inch to 1 Â½ inches (25 mm to 38 mm), but
the needle length is shorter for children. Refer to agency policy for
pediatric needle lengths. The gauge of the needle is determined by the
type of medication administered. Aqueous solutions can be given with a
20- to 25-gauge needle; oily or viscous medications should be
administered with 18- to 21-gauge needles. A smaller gauge needle (22 to
25 gauge) should be used with children. The maximum amount of
medication for a single injection in an adult is 3 mL. See Figure 18.34
for
an image of an intramuscular injection being administered at the vastus
lateralis site.
Deltoid
The deltoid muscle has a triangular shape and is easy to locate and access.
To locate the injection site, begin by having the patient relax their arm.
The patient can be standing, sitting, or lying down. To locate the landmark
for the deltoid muscle, expose the upper arm and find the acromion
process by palpating the bony prominence. The injection site is in the
middle of the deltoid muscle, about 1 inch to 2 inches (2.5 cm  to 5 cm)
below the acromion process. To locate this area, lay three fingers across
the deltoid muscle and below the acromion process. The injection site is
generally three finger widths below in the middle of the muscle. See
Figure 18.35
for an illustration for locating the deltoid injection site.
Select the needle length based on the patientâs age, weight, and body
mass. In general, for an adult male weighing 60 kg to 118 kg (130 to 260
lbs), a 1-inch (25 mm) needle is sufficient. For women under 60 kg (130 lbs),
a  â-inch (16 mm) needle is sufficient, while for women between 60 kg
and 90 kg (130 to 200 lbs) a 1-inch (25 mm) needle is required. A 1 Â½-inch
(38 mm) length needle may be required for women over 90 kg (200 lbs)
for a deltoid IM injection. For immunizations, a 22- to 25-gauge needle
should be used. Refer to agency policy regarding specifications for infants,
children, adolescents, and immunizations. The maximum amount of
medication for a single injection is generally 1 mL. See Figure 18.36

CHAPTER 19 SPECIMEN COLLECTION 19.2 Blood Glucose Monitoring,"Hypoglycemia When caring for patients with diabetes mellitus and monitoring their
blood glucose readings, it is important to continually monitor for signs of
hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is defined as blood sugar readings less than
70 and signs and symptoms such as the following:
â¢  Shakiness
â¢  Feeling nervous or anxious
â¢  Sweating, chills, and clamminess
â¢  Irritability or impatience
â¢  Confusion
â¢  Fast heartbeat
â¢  Feeling light-headed or dizzy
â¢  Hunger
â¢  Nausea
â¢  Color draining from the skin (pallor)
â¢  Feeling sleepy
â¢  Feeling weak or having no energy
â¢  Blurred/impaired vision
â¢  Tingling or numbness in the lips, tongue, or cheeks
â¢  Headaches
â¢  Coordination problems or clumsiness
â¢  Nightmares or crying out during sleep
A low blood sugar level triggers the release of epinephrine (adrenaline),
the âfight-or-flightâ hormone. Epinephrine causes the symptoms of
hypoglycemia such as a rapid heartbeat, sweating, and anxiety. If a
patientâs blood sugar level continues to drop, the brain has impaired
functioning. This  may lead to seizures and a coma.
If a nurse suspects hypoglycemia is occuring, a blood sugar reading
should be obtained and appropriate actions taken. Most agencies have a
hypoglycemia protocol based on the â15-15 Rule.â The 15-15 rule is to
provide 15 grams of carbohydrate and recheck the blood glucose after 15
minutes. If the reading is still below 70 mg/dL, another serving of 15 grams
of carbohydrate should be provided and the process continued until the
blood sugar is above 70 mg/dL. Fifteen grams of carbohydrate includes
options like 4 ounces of juice or regular soda, hard candy, or glucose
tablets. If a patient is experiencing severe hypoglycemia and cannot
swallow, a glucagon injection or intravenous administration of dextrose
may be required.","CHAPTER 19 SPECIMEN COLLECTION 19.2 Blood Glucose Monitoring Hypoglycemia When caring for patients with diabetes mellitus and monitoring their

CHAPTER 19 SPECIMEN COLLECTION 19.2 Blood Glucose Monitoring,"Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia is defined as elevated blood glucose and often causes
signs and symptoms such as frequent urination and increased thirst.
Hyperglycemia occurs when the patientâs body does not produce enough
insulin or cannot use the insulin properly at the cellular level. There are
many potential causes of hyperglycemia, such as not receiving enough
medication to effectively control blood glucose, eating more than
planned, exercising less than planned, or increased stress from an illness,
If a patientâs blood glucose is greater than 240 mg/dL, their urine is
typically checked for ketones. Ketones indicate a condition called
ketoacidosis may be occurring. Ketoacidosis occurs in patients whose
pancreas is no longer creating insulin, so fats are broken down for energy
and waste products called ketones are produced. If the kidneys cannot
effectively eliminate ketones in the urine, they build up in the blood and
cause ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a life-threatening condition that
requires immediate notification of the provider for treatment. Symptoms
of ketoacidosis include fruity-smelling breath, nausea, vomiting, very dry
mouth, and shortness of breath. Treatment of ketoacidosis often requires
the administration of intravenous insulin while the patient is closely
monitored in a critical care inpatient unit.","CHAPTER 19 SPECIMEN COLLECTION 19.2 Blood Glucose Monitoring Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia is defined as elevated blood glucose and often causes

CHAPTER 19 SPECIMEN COLLECTION 19.2 Blood Glucose Monitoring,"Glucometer Use It is typically the responsibility of a nurse to perform bedside blood
glucose readings, but in some agencies, this procedure may be delegated
to trained nursing assistants or medical assistants. See Figure 19.1
for an
image of a standard bedside glucometer kit that contains a glucometer,
lancets, reagent strips, and calibration drops. Prior to performing a blood
glucose test, read the manufacturerâs instructions and agency policy
because they may vary across devices and sites. Ensure the glucometer
has been calibrated per agency policy.
Before beginning the procedure, determine if there are any conditions
present that could affect the reading. For example, is the patient fasting?
Has the patient already begun eating? Is the patient demonstrating any
symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia? Keep your patient safe by
applying your knowledge of diabetes, the medication being administered,
and the uniqueness of the patient to make appropriate clinical judgments
regarding the procedure and associated medication administration.
See the âChecklist for Blood Glucose Monitoringâ for details regarding the
procedure. It is often important to keep the patientâs hand warm and in a
sample. If necessary, warm compresses can be applied for 10 minutes prior
to the procedure to promote vasodilation. Follow the manufacturerâs
instructions to prepare the glucometer for measurement. After applying
clean gloves, clean the patientâs skin with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds,
allow the site to dry, and then puncture the skin using the lancet. See
Figure 19.2
for an image of performing a skin puncture using a lancet.
If needed, gently squeeze above the site to obtain a large drop of blood.
Do not milk or massage the finger because it may introduce excess tissue
fluid and hemolyze the specimen. Wipe away the first drop of blood and
use the second drop for the blood sample. Follow agency policy and
manufacturer instructions regarding placement of the drop of blood forfor an image of a nurseabsorption on the reagent strip. See Figure 19.3

CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE 20.2 Basic Concepts Related to Wounds,"Types of Wound Healing There are three types of wound healing: primary intention, secondary
intention, and tertiary intention. Healing by primary intention means that
the wound is sutured, stapled, glued, or otherwise closed so the wound
heals beneath the closure. This type of healing occurs with clean-edged
lacerations or surgical incisions, and the closed edges are referred to as
approximated. See Figure 20.2
for an image of a surgical wound healing
by primary intention.
Secondary intention occurs when the edges of a wound cannot be
approximated (brought together), so the wound fills in from the bottom
up by the production of granulation tissue. Examples of wounds that heal
by secondary intention are pressure injuries and chainsaw injuries.
Wounds that heal by secondary infection are at higher risk for infection
and must be protected from contamination. See Figure 20.3
for an image
of a wound healing by secondary intention.
Tertiary intention refers to a wound that has had to remain open or has
been reopened, often due to severe infection. The wound is typically
closed at a later date when infection has resolved. Wounds that heal by
secondary and tertiary intention have delayed healing times and
increased scar tissue.","CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE 20.2 Basic Concepts Related to Wounds Types of Wound Healing There are three types of wound healing: primary intention, secondary

CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE 20.2 Basic Concepts Related to Wounds,"Common Types of Wounds There are several different types of wounds. It is important to understand
different types of wounds when providing wound care because each type
of wound has different characteristics and treatments. Additionally,
treatments that may be helpful for one type of wound can be harmful for
another type. Common types of wounds include skin tears, venous ulcers,
arterial ulcers, diabetic foot wounds, and pressure injuries.
Skin Tears
Skin tears are wounds caused by mechanical forces such as shear, friction,
or blunt force. They typically occur in the fragile, nonelastic skin of older
adults or in patients undergoing long-term corticosteroid therapy. Skin
tears can be caused by the simple mechanical force used to remove an
adhesive bandage or from friction as the skin brushes against a surface.
Skin tears occur in the epidermis and dermis but do not extend through
the subcutaneous layer. The wound bases of skin tears are typically fragile
and bleed easily.
Venous Ulcers
Venous ulcers are caused by lack of blood return to the heart causing
hydrostatic pressure in the veins causes fluid to seep out, macerate the
skin, and cause venous ulcerations. Maceration refers to the softening and
wasting away of skin due to excess fluid. Venous ulcers typically occur on
the medial lower leg and have irregular edges due to the maceration.
There is often a dark-colored discoloration of the lower legs, due to blood
pooling and leakage of iron into the skin called hemosiderin staining. For
venous ulcers to heal, compression dressings must be used, along with
multilayer bandage systems, to control edema and absorb large amounts
of drainage.
See Figure 20.8
for an image of a venous ulcer.
Arterial Ulcers
Arterial ulcers are caused by lack of blood flow and oxygenation to tissues.
They typically occur in the distal areas of the body such as the feet, heels,
and toes. Arterial ulcers have well-defined borders with a âpunched outâ
appearance where there is a localized lack of blood flow. They are typically
painful due to the lack of oxygenation to the area. The wound base may
become necrotic (black) due to tissue death from ischemia. Wound
dressings must maintain a moist environment, and treatment must
include the removal of necrotic tissue. In severe arterial ulcers, vascular
surgery may be required to reestablish blood supply to the area.
Figure 20.9
for an image of an arterial ulcer on a patientâs foot.
See
Diabetic Ulcers
Diabetic ulcers are also called neuropathic ulcers because peripheral
neuropathy is commonly present in patients with diabetes. Peripheral
neuropathy is a medical condition that causes decreased sensation of
typically develop on the plantar aspect of the feet and toes of a patient
with diabetes due to lack of sensation of pressure or injury. See Figure
20.10
for an image of a diabetic ulcer. Wound healing is compromised in
patients with diabetes due to the disease process. In addition, there is a
higher risk of developing an infection that can reach the bone requiring
amputation of the area. To prevent diabetic ulcers from occurring, it is vital
for nurses to teach meticulous foot care to patients with diabetes and
encourage the use of well-fitting shoes.
Pressure Injuries
underlying soft tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of
intense and prolonged pressure in combination with shear.â
Shear
occurs when tissue layers move over the top of each other, causing blood
vessels to stretch and break as they pass through the subcutaneous tissue.
For example, when a patient slides down in bed, the outer skin remains
immobile because it remains attached to the sheets due to friction, but
deeper tissue attached to the bone moves as the patient slides down. This
opposing movement of the outer layer of skin and the underlying tissues
causes the capillaries to stretch and tear, which then impacts the blood
flow and oxygenation of the surrounding tissues.
BRADEN SCALESeveral factors place a patient at risk for developing pressure injuries,
including nutrition, mobility, sensation, and moisture. The Braden Scale is
a tool commonly used in health care to provide an objective assessment of
a patientâs risk for developing pressure injuries. See Figure 20.11
for an
image of a Braden Scale. The six risk factors included on the Braden Scale
are sensory perception, moisture, activity, mobility, nutrition, and friction/
shear, and these factors are rated on a scale from 1-4 with 1 being
âcompletely limitedâ to 4 being âno impairment.â The scores from the six
categories are added, and the total score indicates a patientâs risk for
developing a pressure injury. Ranges of scores indicate mild risk for scores
15-19, moderate risk for scores 13-14, high risk for scores 10-12, and severe
risk for scores less than 9. Nurses create care plans using these scores to
plan interventions that prevent or treat pressure injuries.
âIntegumentaryâ chapter of the Open RN Nursing Fundamentalstextbook.
STAGINGPressure injuries commonly occur on the sacrum, heels, ischial tuberosity,
and coccyx. The 2016 National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP)
Pressure Injury Staging System now uses the term âpressure injuryâ
instead of pressure ulcer because an injury can occur without an ulcer
present. Pressure injuries are staged from 1 through 4 based on the extent
of tissue damage. For example, Stage 1 pressure injuries have reddened
but intact skin, and Stage 4 pressure injuries have deep, open ulcers
affecting underlying tissue and structures such as muscles, ligaments, and
tendons. See Figure 20.12
for an image of the four stages of pressure
injuries.
The NPUAPâs definitions of the four stages of pressure injuries
are described below:
â¢  Stage 1 pressure injuries are intact skin with a localized area of
nonblanchable erythema where prolonged pressure has occurred.
Nonblanchable erythema is a medical term used to describe skin
redness that does not turn white when pressed.
â¢  Stage 2 pressure injuries are partial-thickness loss of skin with
exposed dermis. The wound bed is viable and may appear like an
intact or ruptured blister. Stage 2 pressure injuries heal by
reepithelialization and not by granulation tissue formation.
â¢  Stage 3 pressure injuries are full-thickness tissue loss in which fat is
visible, but cartilage, tendon, ligament, muscle, and bone are not
exposed. The depth of tissue damage varies by anatomical location.
Undermining and tunneling may occur in Stage 3 and 4 pressure
injuries. Undermining occurs when the tissue under the wound edges
becomes eroded, resulting in a pocket beneath the skin at the
woundâs edge. Tunneling refers to passageways underneath the
surface of the skin that extend from a wound and can take twists and
turns. Slough and eschar may also be present in Stage 3 and 4
light yellow, soft, and moist. Eschar is dark brown/black, dry, thick, and
leathery dead tissue. See Figure 20.13
for an image of eschar in the
center of the wound. If slough or eschar obscures the wound so that
tissue loss cannot be assessed, the pressure injury is referred to as
unstageable.
In most wounds, slough and eschar must be removed
by debridement for healing to occur.
â¢  Stage 4 pressure injuries are full-thickness tissue loss like Stage 3
pressure injuries, but also have exposed cartilage, tendon, ligament,
muscle, or bone. Osteomyelitis (bone infection) may be present.

for an image of a venous ulcer.
Arterial Ulcers
Arterial ulcers are caused by lack of blood flow and oxygenation to tissues.
They typically occur in the distal areas of the body such as the feet, heels,
and toes. Arterial ulcers have well-defined borders with a âpunched outâ
appearance where there is a localized lack of blood flow. They are typically
painful due to the lack of oxygenation to the area. The wound base may
become necrotic (black) due to tissue death from ischemia. Wound
dressings must maintain a moist environment, and treatment must
include the removal of necrotic tissue. In severe arterial ulcers, vascular
surgery may be required to reestablish blood supply to the area.

Diabetic Ulcers
Diabetic ulcers are also called neuropathic ulcers because peripheral
neuropathy is commonly present in patients with diabetes. Peripheral
neuropathy is a medical condition that causes decreased sensation of
typically develop on the plantar aspect of the feet and toes of a patient
with diabetes due to lack of sensation of pressure or injury. See Figure
20.10
for an image of a diabetic ulcer. Wound healing is compromised in
patients with diabetes due to the disease process. In addition, there is a
higher risk of developing an infection that can reach the bone requiring
amputation of the area. To prevent diabetic ulcers from occurring, it is vital
for nurses to teach meticulous foot care to patients with diabetes and
encourage the use of well-fitting shoes.
Pressure Injuries
underlying soft tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of
intense and prolonged pressure in combination with shear.â
Shear
occurs when tissue layers move over the top of each other, causing blood
vessels to stretch and break as they pass through the subcutaneous tissue.
For example, when a patient slides down in bed, the outer skin remains
immobile because it remains attached to the sheets due to friction, but
deeper tissue attached to the bone moves as the patient slides down. This
opposing movement of the outer layer of skin and the underlying tissues
causes the capillaries to stretch and tear, which then impacts the blood
flow and oxygenation of the surrounding tissues.
BRADEN SCALESeveral factors place a patient at risk for developing pressure injuries,
including nutrition, mobility, sensation, and moisture. The Braden Scale is
a tool commonly used in health care to provide an objective assessment of
a patientâs risk for developing pressure injuries. See Figure 20.11
for an
image of a Braden Scale. The six risk factors included on the Braden Scale
are sensory perception, moisture, activity, mobility, nutrition, and friction/
shear, and these factors are rated on a scale from 1-4 with 1 being
âcompletely limitedâ to 4 being âno impairment.â The scores from the six
categories are added, and the total score indicates a patientâs risk for
developing a pressure injury. Ranges of scores indicate mild risk for scores
15-19, moderate risk for scores 13-14, high risk for scores 10-12, and severe
risk for scores less than 9. Nurses create care plans using these scores to
plan interventions that prevent or treat pressure injuries.
âIntegumentaryâ chapter of the Open RN Nursing Fundamentalstextbook.
STAGINGPressure injuries commonly occur on the sacrum, heels, ischial tuberosity,
and coccyx. The 2016 National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP)
Pressure Injury Staging System now uses the term âpressure injuryâ
instead of pressure ulcer because an injury can occur without an ulcer
present. Pressure injuries are staged from 1 through 4 based on the extent
of tissue damage. For example, Stage 1 pressure injuries have reddened
but intact skin, and Stage 4 pressure injuries have deep, open ulcers
affecting underlying tissue and structures such as muscles, ligaments, and
tendons. See Figure 20.12
for an image of the four stages of pressure
injuries.
The NPUAPâs definitions of the four stages of pressure injuries
are described below:
â¢  Stage 1 pressure injuries are intact skin with a localized area of
nonblanchable erythema where prolonged pressure has occurred.
Nonblanchable erythema is a medical term used to describe skin
redness that does not turn white when pressed.
â¢  Stage 2 pressure injuries are partial-thickness loss of skin with
exposed dermis. The wound bed is viable and may appear like an
intact or ruptured blister. Stage 2 pressure injuries heal by
reepithelialization and not by granulation tissue formation.
â¢  Stage 3 pressure injuries are full-thickness tissue loss in which fat is
visible, but cartilage, tendon, ligament, muscle, and bone are not
exposed. The depth of tissue damage varies by anatomical location.
Undermining and tunneling may occur in Stage 3 and 4 pressure
injuries. Undermining occurs when the tissue under the wound edges
becomes eroded, resulting in a pocket beneath the skin at the
woundâs edge. Tunneling refers to passageways underneath the
surface of the skin that extend from a wound and can take twists and
turns. Slough and eschar may also be present in Stage 3 and 4
light yellow, soft, and moist. Eschar is dark brown/black, dry, thick, and
leathery dead tissue. See Figure 20.13
for an image of eschar in the
center of the wound. If slough or eschar obscures the wound so that
tissue loss cannot be assessed, the pressure injury is referred to as
unstageable.
In most wounds, slough and eschar must be removed
by debridement for healing to occur.
â¢  Stage 4 pressure injuries are full-thickness tissue loss like Stage 3
pressure injuries, but also have exposed cartilage, tendon, ligament,
muscle, or bone. Osteomyelitis (bone infection) may be present.

CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE 20.2 Basic Concepts Related to Wounds,"Factors Affecting Wound Healing Multiple factors affect a woundâs ability to heal and are referred to as local
and systemic factors. Local factors refer to factors that directly affect the
wound, whereas systemic factors refer to the overall health of the patient
and their ability to heal. Local factors include localized blood flow and
oxygenation of the tissue, the presence of infection or a foreign body, and
venous sufficiency. Venous insufficiency is a medical condition where the
veins in the legs do not adequately send blood back to the heart, resulting
in a pooling of fluids in the legs.
Systemic factors that affect a patientâs ability to heal include nutrition,
mobility, stress, diabetes, age, obesity, medications, alcohol use, and
smoking.
When a nurse is caring for a patient with a wound that is not
healing as anticipated, it is important to further assess for the potential
impact of these factors:
â¢  Nutrition. Nutritional deficiencies can have a profound impact on
healing and must be addressed for chronic wounds to heal. Protein is
one of the most important nutritional factors affecting wound healing.
For example, in patients with pressure injuries, 30 to 35 kcal/kg of
calorie intake with 1.25 to 1.5g/kg of protein and micronutrients
supplementation is recommended daily.
In addition, vitamin C and
zinc deficiency have many roles in wound healing. It is important to
collaborate with a dietician to identify and manage nutritional
deficiencies when a patient is experiencing poor wound healing.
â¢  Stress. Stress causes an impaired immune response that results in
delayed wound healing. Although a patient cannot necessarily control
the amount of stress in their life, it is possible to control oneâs reaction
to stress with healthy coping mechanisms. The nurse can help
educate the patient about healthy coping strategies.
â¢  Diabetes. Diabetes causes delayed wound healing due to many
factors such as neuropathy, atherosclerosis (a buildup of plaque that
obstructs blood flow in the arteries resulting in decreased oxygenation
of tissues), a decreased host immune resistance, and increased risk for
infection.
Read more about neuropathy and diabetic ulcers under
the âTypes of Woundsâ section. Nurses provide vital patient education
to patients with diabetes to effectively manage the disease process for
improved wound healing.
â¢  Age. Older adults have an altered inflammatory response that can
impair wound healing. Nurses can educate patients about the
importance of exercise for improved wound healing in older adults.
â¢  Obesity. Obese individuals frequently have wound complications,
including infection, dehiscence, hematoma formation, pressure
injuries, and venous injuries. Nurses can educate patients about
healthy lifestyle choices to reduce obesity in patients with chronic
wounds.
â¢  Medications. Medications such as corticosteroids impair wound
healing due to reduced formation of granulation tissue.
When
assessing a chronic wound that is not healing as expected, it is
important to consider the side effects of the patientâs medications.
â¢  Alcohol consumption. Research shows that exposure to alcohol
impairs wound healing and increases the incidence of

â¢  Smoking. Smoking impacts the inflammatory phase of the wound
healing process, resulting in poor wound healing and an increased risk
of infection.

Lab Values Affecting Wound Healing
When a chronic wound is not healing as expected, laboratory test results
may provide additional clues regarding the causes of the delayed healing.
See Table 20.2 for lab results that offer clues to systemic issues causing
delayed wound healing.
Table 20.2 Lab Values Associated with Delayed Wound Healing
Wound ComplicationsIn addition to delayed wound healing, several other complications can
occur. Three common complications are the development of a hematoma,
infection, or dehiscence. These complications should be immediately
reported to the health care provider.
Hematoma
A hematoma is an area of blood that collects outside of the larger blood
vessels. A hematoma is more severe than ecchymosis (bruising) that
occurs when small veins and capillaries under the skin break. The
development of a hematoma at a surgical site can lead to infection and
incisional dehiscence.
See Figure 20.14
for an image of a hematoma.
Infection
A break in the skin allows bacteria to enter and begin to multiply. Microbial
contamination of wounds can progress from localized infection to
systemic infection, sepsis, and subsequent life- and limb-threatening
infection. Signs of a localized wound infection include redness, warmth,
and tenderness around the wound. Purulent or malodorous drainage may
also be present. Signs that a systemic infection is developing and requires
urgent medical management include the following:
â¢  Fever over 101 F (38 C)
â¢  Overall malaise (lack of energy and not feeling well)
â¢  Change in level of consciousness/increased confusion
â¢  Increasing or continual pain in the wound
â¢  Expanding redness or swelling around the wound
â¢  Loss of movement or function of the wounded area
Dehiscence
Dehiscence refers to the separation of the edges of a surgical wound. A
dehisced wound can appear fully open where the tissue underneath is
visible, or it can be partial where just a portion of the wound has torn
open. Wound dehiscence is always a risk in a surgical wound, but the risk
increases if the patient is obese, smokes, or has other health conditions,
such as diabetes, that impact wound healing. Additionally, the location of
the wound and the amount of physical activity in that area also increase
dehiscence in an abdominal surgical wound in a 50-year-old obese female
with a history of smoking and malnutrition.
Wound dehiscence can occur suddenly, especially in abdominal wounds
when the patient is coughing or straining. Evisceration is a rare but severe
surgical complication when dehiscence occurs and the abdominal organs
protrude out of the incision. Signs of impending dehiscence include
redness around the wound margins and increasing drainage from the
incision. The wound will also likely become increasingly painful. Suture
breakage can be a sign that the wound has minor dehiscence or is about
to dehisce.
To prevent wound dehiscence, surgical patients must follow all post-op
instructions carefully. The patient must move carefully and protect the
skin from being pulled around the wound site. They should also avoid
tensing the muscles surrounding the wound and avoid heavy lifting as
advised.","CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE 20.2 Basic Concepts Related to Wounds Factors Affecting Wound Healing Multiple factors affect a woundâs ability to heal and are referred to as local

CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE 20.5 Wound Dressings,"Types of Tape There are several types of tape that can be used to secure dressings. The
most commonly used types of tape are medical transpore, micropore
paper, cloth, and waterproof tape.
â¢  Medical transpore tape (often referred to as âmedi-poreâ) is
inexpensive, durable, and very sticky. It has tiny holes in it that allow air
through it without causing it to come off. However, it leaves residue
and can damage sensitive skin.
â¢  Micropore paper tape is gentle on skin and doesnât leave residue, but
it is not waterproof and doesnât work well on irregular areas. It allows
air to reach the skin underneath.
â¢  Cloth tape sticks well, allows air to reach the skin, and does not leave a
residue. It has high strength so it can be used to secure a splint.
However, it is not flexible or waterproof and can be difficult to tear.
â¢  Waterproof tape is more expensive but it is flexible and doesnât leave
residue. It sticks well to skin but does not stick well to hair. It is
waterproof when applied to dry skin.","CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE 20.5 Wound Dressings Types of Tape There are several types of tape that can be used to secure dressings. The

CHAPTER 20 WOUND CARE 20.5 Wound Dressings,"Wound Vacs The term wound vac refers to a device used with special foam dressings
and suctioning to remove fluid and decrease air pressure around a wound
to assist in healing. During a wound vac procedure, the nurse applies a
special foam dressing over an open wound and seals it with a thin film
layer. The film has an opening that rubber tubing fits through to connect
to a vacuum pump. Once connected, the vacuum pump removes fluid
from the wound while also helping to pull the edges of the wound
together. A person with a wound vac typically wears the device 24 hours a
day while the wound is healing.

Suture Removal.â
Steps
Disclaimer: Always review and follow agency policy regarding this
specific skill.
1.  Gather supplies: sterile suture scissors, sterile dressing tray (to clean
incision site prior to suture removal), nonsterile gloves, normal saline,
Steri-Strips, and sterile outer dressing.
2.  Perform safety steps:
â¦  Perform hand hygiene.
â¦  Check the room for transmission-based precautions.â¦  Introduce yourself, your role, the purpose of your visit, and an
estimate of the time it will take.
â¦  Confirm patient ID using two patient identifiers (e.g., name and
date of birth).
â¦  Explain the process to the patient and ask if they have any
questions.
â¦  Be organized and systematic.â¦  Use appropriate listening and questioning skills.â¦  Listen and attend to patient cues.â¦  Ensure the patientâs privacy and dignity.â¦  Assess ABCs.
3.  Confirm provider order and explain procedure to patient. Inform the
patient that the procedure is not painful but they may feel some
pulling of the skin during suture removal.
4.  Prepare the environment, position the patient, adjust the height of
the bed, and turn on the lights. Ensuring proper lighting allows for
good visibility to assess the wound. Ensure proper body mechanics for
yourself and create a comfortable position for the patient.
5.  Perform hand hygiene and put on nonsterile gloves.
6.  Place a clean, dry barrier on the bedside table. Add necessary supplies.
7.  Remove dressing and inspect the wound. Visually assess the wound
and swelling. After assessing the wound, decide if the wound is
sufficiently healed to have the sutures removed. If there are concerns,
discuss the order with the appropriate health care provider.
8.  Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
9.  Put on a new pair of nonsterile or sterile gloves, depending on the
patientâs condition and the type, location, and depth of the wound.
10.  Irrigate the wound with sterile normal saline solution to remove
surface debris or exudate and to help prevent specimen
contamination. Alternatively, commercial wound cleanser may be
used. This step reduces risk of infection from microorganisms on the
wound site or surrounding skin. Cleaning also loosens and removes
any dried blood or crusted exudate from the sutures and wound bed.
11.  To remove intermittent sutures, hold the scissors in your dominant
hand and the forceps in your nondominant hand for dexterity with
suture removal.
12.  Place a sterile 2â³ x 2â³ gauze close to the incision site to collect the
removed suture pieces.
13.  Grasp the knot of the suture with the forceps and gently pull up the
knot while slipping the tip of the scissors under the suture near the
skin. Examine the knot.
14.  Cut under the knot as close as possible to the skin at the distal end of
the knot:
â¦  Never snip both ends of the knot as there will be no way to
remove the suture from below the surface.
â¦  Do not pull the contaminated suture (suture on top of the skin)
through tissue.
15.  Grasp the knotted end of the suture with forceps, and in one
continuous action pull the suture out of the tissue and place it on the
sterile 2â³ x 2â³ gauze.
16.  Remove every second suture until the end of the incision line. Assess
remaining suture will be removed. If the wound edges are open, stop
removing sutures, apply Steri-Strips (using tension to pull wound
edges together), and notify the appropriate health care provider.
Remove remaining sutures on the incision line if indicated.
17.  Using the principles of no-touch technique, cut and place Steri-Strips
along the incision line:
â¦  Cut Steri-Strips so that they extend 1.5 to 2 inches on each side of
the incision.
18.  Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.
19.  Assist the patient to a comfortable position, ask if they have any
questions, and thank them for their time. Return the patientâs bed to
the lowest position to help prevent falls and maintain patient safety.
20.  Ensure safety measures when leaving the room:
â¦  CALL LIGHT: Within reachâ¦  BED: Low and locked (in lowest position and brakes on)â¦  SIDE RAILS: Securedâ¦  TABLE: Within reachâ¦  ROOM: Risk-free for falls (scan room and clear any obstacles)

âStaple Removal.â
Steps
Disclaimer: Always review and follow agency policy regarding this
specific skill.
1.  Gather supplies: sterile staple extractors, sterile dressing tray,
nonsterile gloves, normal saline, Steri-Strips, and sterile outer dressing.
2.  Perform safety steps:
â¦  Perform hand hygiene.â¦  Check room for transmission-based precautions.â¦  Introduce yourself, your role, the purpose of your visit, and an
estimate of the time it will take.
â¦  Confirm patient ID using two patient identifiers (e.g., name and
date of birth).
â¦  Be organized and systematic.â¦  Use appropriate listening and questioning skills.â¦  Listen and attend to patient cues.â¦  Ensure the patientâs privacy and dignity.â¦  Assess ABCs.
3.  Confirm the provider order and explain the procedure to patient.
Explanation helps prevent anxiety and increases compliance with the
procedure. Inform the patient the procedure is not painful but theymay feel some pulling or pinching of the skin during staple removal.
4.  Prepare the environment, position the patient, adjust the height of
the bed, and turn on the lights. Ensuring proper lighting allows for
good visibility to assess the wound. Ensure proper body mechanics for
yourself and create a comfortable position for the patient.
5.  Place a clean, dry barrier on the bedside tables and add necessary
supplies.
6.  Perform hand hygiene and apply nonsterile gloves.
7.  Remove the dressing and inspect the wound. Visually assess the
wound for uniform closure of the wound edges, absence of drainage,
redness, and swelling. After assessing the wound, decide if the wound
is sufficiently healed to have the staples removed. If there are
concerns, discuss the status of the wound before proceeding with the
health care provider. For safety purposes, count the number of staples
before beginning the procedure.
8.  Irrigate the wound with sterile normal saline solution to remove
surface debris or exudate to reduce risk of infection from
microorganisms on the wound site or surrounding skin and to help
loosen and remove any dried blood or crusted exudate from the
sutures and wound bed.
9.  Remove gloves, perform hand hygiene, and apply nonsterile gloves.
10.  Place a sterile 2â³ x 2â³ next to the wound to collect the staples.
11.  Remove the staples (start with every second staple).
12.  Place the lower tip of the staple extractor beneath the staple. Do not
pull up while depressing the handle on the staple remover or change
the angle of your wrist or hand. Close the handle, and then gently
move the staple side to side to remove. The closed handle depresses
the middle of the staple causing the two ends to bend outward and
out of the top layer of skin.
13.  When both ends of the staple are visible, move the staple extractor
away from the skin and place the staple on a sterile piece of gauze by
releasing the handles on the staple extractor. This avoids pulling the
staple out prematurely and avoids putting pressure on the wound. It
14.  Using the principles of no-touch technique, place Steri-Strips on the
location of every removed staple along the incision line. Steri-Strips are
supplied in pre-cut lengths. Cut the Steri-Strips to allow them to
extend 1.5 to 2 cm on each side of the incision. Steri-Strips support
wound tension across wounds and eliminate scarring. This allows
wounds to heal by primary intention.
15.  Remove the remaining staples as indicated, followed by applying
Steri-Strips along the incision line. Count the number of removed
staples and compare to the pre-count to ensure safety.
16.  Apply a dry, sterile dressing on the incision site or leave it exposed to
the air according to provider orders.
17.  Discard the supplies according to agency policies for sharps disposal
and biohazard waste:
â¦  The staple extractor may be disposed of or sent for sterilization
according to agency policy.
18.  Perform hand hygiene.
19.  Complete patient teaching regarding Steri-Strips, bathing, and
inspecting wound for separation. Instruct the patient to:
â¦  Take showers rather than bathe in a tub.â¦  Avoid pulling off Steri-Strips but allow them to fall off naturally and
gradually (usually takes one to three weeks).
â¦  Receive adequate rest, fluids, nutrition, and ambulation for
optional wound healing
20.  Assist the patient to a comfortable position, ask if they have any
questions, and thank them for their time.

1.  Gather supplies: syringe, cannula with needleless adaptor, irrigation
fluid, basin, waterproof pad, dressing tray with sterile forceps, scissors,
skin barrier/protectant, cotton tip applicators, measuring guide, outer
sterile dressing, and packing gauze or packing as per physicianâs
orders.
2.  Perform safety steps:
â¦  Perform hand hygiene.â¦  Check the room for transmission-based precautions.â¦  Introduce yourself, your role, the purpose of your visit, and an
estimate of the time it will take.
â¦  Confirm patient ID using two patient identifiers (e.g., name and

â¦  Explain the process to the patient and ask if they have any
questions.
â¦  Be organized and systematic.â¦  Use appropriate listening and questioning skills.â¦  Listen and attend to patient cues.â¦  Ensure the patientâs privacy and dignity.â¦  Assess ABCs.
3.  Confirm the provider order and verify appropriateness of order
according to wound assessment.
4.  Prepare the environment, position the patient, adjust the height of
the bed, and turn on the lights. Ensure proper lighting to allow for
good visibility to assess the wound. Ensure proper body mechanics for
yourself and create a comfortable position for the patient. Position the
patient so the wound is vertical to the collection basin, if possible, to
allow the solution to flow off the patient.
5.  Place a waterproof pad under the patient to protect the patientâs
6.  Perform hand hygiene and apply clean gloves.
7.  Remove outer dressing:
â¦  Using sterile forceps, remove the inner dressing (packing) from
the wound.
â¦  If the packing sticks, gently soak the packing with normal saline or
sterile water and gently lift off the packing. Removing packing
that adheres to the wound bed without soaking can cause trauma
to the wound bed tissue. If packing material cannot be removed,
contact the provider. If packing adheres to the wound, reassess
the amount of wound exudate and consider a different packing
material. All packing must be removed with each dressing
change.
â¦  Confirm the quantity and type of packing are the same as
recorded on previous dressing change.
8.  Assess the wound:
â¦  Note the location and type of wound.â¦  Measure the woundâs length, width, and depth.â¦  If undermining or tunneling are present, note the location and
measure the depth.
â¦  Determine if the level of tissue damage indicates wound healing
or worsening.
â¦  Assess appearance of wound bed, noting color.â¦  Note presence of odor after cleansing.â¦  Assess appearance of periwound skin.â¦  Wound assessment helps identify if the wound care is effective.
Always compare the current wound assessment with the previous
assessment to determine if the wound is healing, delayed,
worsening, or showing signs of infection.
9.  Apply nonsterile gloves, gown, and goggles or face shield according to
agency policy.
10.  If irrigation is indicated, fill a 35-mL syringe with sterile saline and
attach a needleless cannula to the end of the syringe.
11.  Hold the syringe about 1 inch above the wound and flush gently with
continuous pressure until returned fluid is clear:
â¦  Irrigation should be drained into the basin because it is a medium
for bacterial growth and subsequent infection.â¦  Irrigation should not increase patient discomfort.
12.  Dry wound edges with sterile gauze using sterile forceps to prevent
maceration of surrounding tissue from excess moisture.
13.  Remove goggles or face shield and gloves.
14.  Perform hand hygiene and apply sterile gloves (if not using sterile
forceps) or nonsterile gloves if using sterile forceps.
15.  Apply a skin barrier/protectant on the periwound skin as needed to
prevent saturated packing materials and/or wound exudate from
macerating or irritating the periwound skin.
16.  While maintaining sterility, moisten the gauze with sterile normal
saline and wring it out so it is damp but not wet:
â¦  The wound must be moist, not wet, for optimal healing. Gauze
packing that is too wet can cause tissue maceration and reduces
the absorbency of the gauze.
â¦  Normal saline gauze packing needs to be changed at least once
daily.
â¦  Ensure the wound is not overpacked or underpacked as either
may diminish the healing process.
17.  Open the gauze and gently pack it into the wound using sterile
forceps or the tip of a sterile, cotton-tipped swab:
â¦  Continue until all wound surfaces are in contact with gauze.â¦  Do not pack too tightly.â¦  Do not overlap wound edges with wet packing.
18.  Apply an appropriate outer dry dressing, depending on the frequency
of the dressing changes and the amount of exudate from the wound:
â¦  The dressing on the wound must remain dry on the outside to
avoid cross-contamination of the wound. If it becomes saturated
before the next dressing change, it must be replaced.

CHAPTER 21 FACILITATION OF ELIMINATION 21.2 Basic Concepts,"Urinary Elimination Devices This section will focus on the devices used to facilitate urinary elimination.
Urinary catheterization is the insertion of a catheter tube into the urethral
opening and placing it in the neck of the urinary bladder to drain urine.
There are several types of urinary elimination devices, such as indwelling
catheters, intermittent catheters, suprapubic catheters, and external
devices.  Each of these types of devices is described in the following
subsections.
Indwelling Catheter
An indwelling catheter, often referred to as a âFoley catheter,â refers to a
urinary catheter that remains in place after insertion into the bladder for
the continual collection of urine. It has a balloon on the insertion tip to
maintain placement in the neck of the bladder. The other end of the
catheter is attached to a drainage bag for the collection of urine. See
Figure 21.1
for an illustration of the anatomical placement of an indwelling
catheter in the bladder neck.
The distal end of an indwelling catheter has a urine drainage port that is
connected to a drainage bag. The size of the catheter is marked at this
end, where a syringe is inserted to inflate the balloon after it is inserted
into the bladder. The balloon port is marked with the amount of fluid
required to fill the balloon. See Figure 21.2
for an image of the parts of an
indwelling catheter.
Catheters have different sizes, with the larger the number indicating a
larger diameter of the catheter. See Figure 21.3
for an image of the French
Catheter Scale.
There are two common types of bags that may be attached to an
indwelling catheter. During inpatient or long-term care, larger collection
bags that can hold up to 2 liters of fluid are used. See Figure 21.4
for an
image of a typical collection bag attached to an indwelling catheter. These
bags should be emptied when they are half to two-thirds full to prevent
traction on the urethra from the bag. Additionally, the collection bag
should always be placed below the level of the patientâs bladder so that
urine flows out of the bladder and urine does not inadvertently flow back
into the bladder. Ensure the tubing is not coiled, kinked, or compressed so
that urine can flow unobstructed into the bag. Slack should be
maintained in the tubing to prevent injury to the patientâs urethra. To
prevent the development of a urinary tract infection, the bag should not
be permitted to touch the floor.
See Figure 21.5
for an illustration of the placement of the urine collection
bag when the patient is lying in bed.
A second type of urine collection bag is a leg bag. Leg bags provide
discretion when the patient is in public because they can be worn underclothing. However, leg bags are small and must be emptied more
for an imagefrequently than those used during inpatient care. Figure 21.6
of leg bag and Figure 21.7
attached to a leg bag.
for an illustration of an indwelling catheter
Straight Catheter
A straight catheter is used for intermittent urinary catheterization. The
catheter is inserted to allow for the flow of urine and then immediately
removed, so a balloon is not required at the insertion tip. See Figure 21.8
for an image of a straight catheter. Intermittent catheterization is used
for the relief of urinary retention. It may be performed once, such as after
surgery when a patient is experiencing urinary retention due to the effects
of anesthesia, or performed several times a day to manage chronic urinary
retention. Some patients may also independently perform self-
catheterization at home to manage chronic urinary retention caused by
various medical conditions. In some situations, a straight catheter is also
used to obtain a sterile urine specimen for culture when a patient is
unable to void into a sterile specimen cup. According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), intermittent catheterization is
preferred to indwelling urethral catheters whenever feasible because of
decreased risk of developing a urinary tract infection.
Other Types of Urinary Catheters
COUDE CATHETER TIPCoude catheter tips are curved to follow the natural curve of the urethra
during catheterization. They are often used when catheterizing male
patients with enlarged prostate glands. See Figure 21.9
for an example of
a urinary catheter with a coude tip. During insertion, the tip of the Coude
catheter must be pointed anteriorly or it can cause damage the urethra. A
thin line embedded in the catheter provides information regarding
orientation during the procedure; maintain the line upwards to keep it
pointed anteriorly.
IRRIGATION CATHETERIrrigation catheters are typically used after prostate surgery to flush the
of fluid to flush. See Figure 21.10
for an image comparing a larger 20
French catheter (typically used for irrigation) to a 14 French catheter
(typically used for indwelling catheters).
SUPRAPUBIC CATHETERSSuprapubic catheters are surgically inserted through the abdominal wall
into the bladder. This type of catheter is typically inserted when there is a
blockage within the urethra that does not allow the use of a straight or
indwelling catheter. Suprapubic catheters may be used for a short period
of time for acute medical conditions or may be used permanently for
chronic conditions. See Figure 21.11
for an image of a suprapubic catheter.
The insertion site of a suprapubic catheter must be cleaned regularly
according to agency policy with appropriate steps to prevent skin
breakdown.
MALE CONDOM CATHETERA condom catheter is a noninvasive device used for males with
incontinence. It is placed over the penis and connected to a drainage bag.
This device protects and promotes healing of the skin around the perineal
area and inner legs and is used as an alternative to an indwelling urinary
catheter. See Figure 21.12

FEMALE EXTERNAL URINARY CATHETER
Female external urinary catheters (FEUC) have been recently introduced
into practice to reduce the incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract
infection (CAUTI) in women.
The external female catheter device is made
of a purewick material that is placed externally over the femaleâs urinary
meatus. The wicking material is attached to a tube that is hooked to a low-
suction device. When the wick becomes saturated with urine, it is
suctioned into a drainage canister. Preliminary studies have found that
utilizing the FEUC device reduced the risk for CAUTI.

Urinary catheterization is the insertion of a catheter tube into the urethral
opening and placing it in the neck of the urinary bladder to drain urine.
There are several types of urinary elimination devices, such as indwelling
catheters, intermittent catheters, suprapubic catheters, and external
devices.  Each of these types of devices is described in the following
subsections.
Indwelling Catheter
An indwelling catheter, often referred to as a âFoley catheter,â refers to a
urinary catheter that remains in place after insertion into the bladder for
the continual collection of urine. It has a balloon on the insertion tip to
maintain placement in the neck of the bladder. The other end of the
catheter is attached to a drainage bag for the collection of urine. See
Figure 21.1
for an illustration of the anatomical placement of an indwelling
catheter in the bladder neck.
The distal end of an indwelling catheter has a urine drainage port that is
connected to a drainage bag. The size of the catheter is marked at this
end, where a syringe is inserted to inflate the balloon after it is inserted
into the bladder. The balloon port is marked with the amount of fluid
required to fill the balloon. See Figure 21.2
for an image of the parts of an
indwelling catheter.
Catheters have different sizes, with the larger the number indicating a
larger diameter of the catheter. See Figure 21.3
for an image of the French
Catheter Scale.
There are two common types of bags that may be attached to an
indwelling catheter. During inpatient or long-term care, larger collection
bags that can hold up to 2 liters of fluid are used. See Figure 21.4
for an
image of a typical collection bag attached to an indwelling catheter. These
bags should be emptied when they are half to two-thirds full to prevent
traction on the urethra from the bag. Additionally, the collection bag
should always be placed below the level of the patientâs bladder so that
urine flows out of the bladder and urine does not inadvertently flow back
into the bladder. Ensure the tubing is not coiled, kinked, or compressed so
that urine can flow unobstructed into the bag. Slack should be
maintained in the tubing to prevent injury to the patientâs urethra. To
prevent the development of a urinary tract infection, the bag should not
be permitted to touch the floor.
See Figure 21.5
for an illustration of the placement of the urine collection
bag when the patient is lying in bed.
A second type of urine collection bag is a leg bag. Leg bags provide
discretion when the patient is in public because they can be worn underclothing. However, leg bags are small and must be emptied more
for an imagefrequently than those used during inpatient care. Figure 21.6
of leg bag and Figure 21.7
attached to a leg bag.
for an illustration of an indwelling catheter
Straight Catheter
A straight catheter is used for intermittent urinary catheterization. The
catheter is inserted to allow for the flow of urine and then immediately
removed, so a balloon is not required at the insertion tip. See Figure 21.8
for an image of a straight catheter. Intermittent catheterization is used
for the relief of urinary retention. It may be performed once, such as after
surgery when a patient is experiencing urinary retention due to the effects
of anesthesia, or performed several times a day to manage chronic urinary
retention. Some patients may also independently perform self-
catheterization at home to manage chronic urinary retention caused by
various medical conditions. In some situations, a straight catheter is also
used to obtain a sterile urine specimen for culture when a patient is
unable to void into a sterile specimen cup. According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), intermittent catheterization is
preferred to indwelling urethral catheters whenever feasible because of
decreased risk of developing a urinary tract infection.
Other Types of Urinary Catheters
COUDE CATHETER TIPCoude catheter tips are curved to follow the natural curve of the urethra
during catheterization. They are often used when catheterizing male
patients with enlarged prostate glands. See Figure 21.9
for an example of
a urinary catheter with a coude tip. During insertion, the tip of the Coude
catheter must be pointed anteriorly or it can cause damage the urethra. A
thin line embedded in the catheter provides information regarding
orientation during the procedure; maintain the line upwards to keep it
pointed anteriorly.
IRRIGATION CATHETERIrrigation catheters are typically used after prostate surgery to flush the
of fluid to flush. See Figure 21.10
for an image comparing a larger 20
French catheter (typically used for irrigation) to a 14 French catheter
(typically used for indwelling catheters).
SUPRAPUBIC CATHETERSSuprapubic catheters are surgically inserted through the abdominal wall
into the bladder. This type of catheter is typically inserted when there is a
blockage within the urethra that does not allow the use of a straight or
indwelling catheter. Suprapubic catheters may be used for a short period
of time for acute medical conditions or may be used permanently for
chronic conditions. See Figure 21.11
for an image of a suprapubic catheter.
The insertion site of a suprapubic catheter must be cleaned regularly
according to agency policy with appropriate steps to prevent skin
breakdown.
MALE CONDOM CATHETERA condom catheter is a noninvasive device used for males with
incontinence. It is placed over the penis and connected to a drainage bag.
This device protects and promotes healing of the skin around the perineal
area and inner legs and is used as an alternative to an indwelling urinary
catheter. See Figure 21.12
for an image of a condom catheter and Figure
21.13
for an illustration of a condom catheter attached to a leg bag.

infection (CAUTI) in women.

It is often helpful to explain the catheterization procedure using a doll or
toy. According to agency policy, a parent, caregiver, or other adult should
be present in the room during the procedure. Asking a younger child to
blow into a straw can help relax the pelvic muscles during catheterization.
Older Adults
The urethral meatus of older women may be difficult to identify due to
atrophy of the urogenital tissue. The risk of developing a urinary tract
infection may also be increased due to chronic disease and incontinence.
Expected Outcomes/Planning
Expected patient outcomes following urinary catheterization should be
planned and then evaluated and documented after the procedure is
completed. See Table 21.8c for sample expected outcomes related to

This chapter will discuss tracheostomy care and various types of
suctioning (e.g., oral, nasal, pharyngeal, and tracheostomy) performed by
nurses. The purpose of respiratory suctioning is to maintain a patent
airway and improve oxygenation by removing mucous secretions and
foreign material (e.g., vomit or gastric secretions). During oral suctioning, a
rigid plastic suction catheter is typically used in a patientâs mouth toremove oral secretions. Nasal and pharyngeal suctioning is performed
with a sterile, soft, flexible catheter to remove accumulated saliva,
pulmonary secretions, blood, vomitus, or other foreign material from
nasopharyngeal areas that cannot be removed by the patientâs
spontaneous cough or other less invasive procedures.
Tracheostomy suctioning uses a sterile catheter that is inserted through a
tracheostomy tube into a patientâs trachea. A tracheostomy tube is a tube
that is inserted through a surgical opening in the neck to the trachea to
create an artificial airway. Tracheostomies require routine care to prevent
infection and obstruction, as well as frequent suctioning to maintain a
patent airway.
Tracheostomy care and suctioning are performed
collaboratively by nurses and respiratory therapists.","CHAPTER 22 TRACHEOSTOMY CARE & SUCTIONING 22.1 Tracheostomy Care & Suctioning Introduction Learning Objectives â¢  Safely perform nasal, oral, pharyngeal, and tracheostomy

CHAPTER 22 TRACHEOSTOMY CARE & SUCTIONING 22.2 Basic Concepts Related to Suctioning,"Respiratory System Anatomy It is important for the nurse to have an understanding of the underlying
structures of the respiratory system before performing suctioning to
ensure that care is given to protect sensitive tissues and that airways are
appropriately assessed during the suctioning procedure. See Figure
22.1
for an illustration of the anatomy of the respiratory system.
Maintaining a patent airway is a top priority and one of the âABCsâ of
patient care (i.e., Airway, Breathing, and Circulation). Suctioning is often
required in acute-care settings for patients who cannot maintain their
own airway due to a variety of medical conditions such as respiratory
failure, stroke, unconsciousness, or postoperative care. The suctioning
procedure is useful for removing mucus that may obstruct the airway and
compromise the patientâs breathing ability.

CHAPTER 22 TRACHEOSTOMY CARE & SUCTIONING 22.2 Basic Concepts Related to Suctioning,"Respiratory Failure and Respiratory Arrest Respiratory failure and respiratory arrest often require emergency
suctioning. Respiratory failure is a life-threatening condition that is caused
when the respiratory system cannot get enough oxygen from the lungs
into the blood to oxygenate the tissues, or there are high levels of carbon
dioxide in the blood that the body cannot effectively eliminate via the
lungs. Acute respiratory failure can happen quickly without much
warning. It is often caused by a disease or injury that affects breathing,
such as pneumonia, opioid overdose, stroke, or a lung or spinal cord injury.
Acute respiratory failure requires emergency treatment. Untreated
respiratory failure can lead to respiratory arrest.
Signs and symptoms of respiratory failure include shortness of breath
(dyspnea), rapid breathing (tachypnea), rapid heart rate (tachycardia),
unusual sweating (diaphoresis), decreasing pulse oximetry readings below
90%, and air hunger (a feeling as if you canât breathe in enough air). In
severe cases, signs and symptoms may include cyanosis (a bluish color of
the skin, lips, and fingernails), confusion, and sleepiness.
The main goal of treating respiratory failure is to ensure that sufficient
oxygen reaches the lungs and is transported to the other organs while
carbon dioxide is cleared from the body.
Treatment measures may
include suctioning to clear the airway while also providing supplemental
oxygen using various oxygenation devices. Severe respiratory distress may
require intubation and mechanical ventilation, or the emergency
placement of a tracheostomy may be performed if the airway is
obstructed. For additional details about oxygenation and various
oxygenation devices, go to the âOxygen Therapyâ chapter.","CHAPTER 22 TRACHEOSTOMY CARE & SUCTIONING 22.2 Basic Concepts Related to Suctioning Respiratory Failure and Respiratory Arrest Respiratory failure and respiratory arrest often require emergency

CHAPTER 22 TRACHEOSTOMY CARE & SUCTIONING 22.2 Basic Concepts Related to Suctioning,"Tracheostomy A tracheostomy is a surgically-created opening called a stoma that goes
from the front of the patientâs neck into the trachea. A tracheostomy tube
is placed through the stoma and directly into the trachea to maintain anfor an illustration of a patient with aopen (patent) airway. See Figure 22.2
tracheostomy tube in place.
Placement of a tracheostomy tube may be performed emergently or as a
planned procedure due to the following:
â¢  A large object blocking the airway
â¢  Respiratory failure or arrest
â¢  Severe neck or mouth injuries
â¢  A swollen or blocked airway due to inhalation of harmful material such
as smoke, steam, or other toxic gases
â¢  Cancer of the throat or neck, which can affect breathing by pressing
on the airway
â¢  Paralysis of the muscles that affect swallowing
â¢  Surgery around the larynx that prevents normal breathing and
swallowing
â¢  Long-term oxygen therapy via a mechanical ventilator
See Figure 22.3
for an image of the parts of a tracheostomy tube. The
outside end of the outer cannula has a flange that is placed against the
patientâs neck. The flange is secured around the patientâs neck with tie
straps, and a split 4â³ x 4â³ tracheostomy dressing is placed under the flange
to absorb secretions. A cuff is typically present on the distal end of the
outer cannula to make a tight seal in the airway. (See the top image in
Figure 22.3.) The cuff is inflated and deflated with a syringe attached to the
pilot balloon. Most tracheostomy tubes have a hollow inner cannula inside
the outer cannula that is either disposable or removed for cleaning as part
of the tracheostomy care procedure. (See the middle image of Figure 22.3.)
A solid obturator is used during the initial tracheostomy insertion
procedure to help guide the outer cannula through the tracheostomy and
insertion and the inner cannula is slid into place.
When a tracheostomy is placed, the provider determines if a fenestrated
or unfenestrated outer cannula is needed based on the patientâs
condition. A fenestrated tube is used for patients who can speak with
their tracheostomy tube in place. Under the guidance of a speech
pathologist and respiratory therapist, the inner cannula is eventually
removed from a fenestrated tube and the cuff deflated so the patient isable to speak. Otherwise, a patient with a tracheostomy tube is unable to
speak because there is no airflow over the vocal cords, and alternative
communication measures, such as a whiteboard, pen and paper, or

nurse. Suctioning should never be performed through a fenestrated tube
without first inserting a nonfenestrated inner cannula, or severe tracheal
for images of a fenestrated anddamage can occur. See Figure 22.4
nonfenestrated outer cannula.
Caring for a patient with a tracheostomy tube includes providing routine
tracheostomy care and suctioning. Tracheostomy care is a procedure
performed routinely to keep the flange, tracheostomy dressing, ties or
straps, and surrounding area clean to reduce the introduction of bacteria
into the trachea and lungs. The inner cannula becomes occluded withsecretions and must be cleaned or replaced frequently according to
agency policy to maintain an open airway. Suctioning through the
tracheostomy tube is also performed to remove mucus and to maintain a
patent airway.","CHAPTER 22 TRACHEOSTOMY CARE & SUCTIONING 22.2 Basic Concepts Related to Suctioning Tracheostomy A tracheostomy is a surgically-created opening called a stoma that goes
from the front of the patientâs neck into the trachea. A tracheostomy tube
is placed through the stoma and directly into the trachea to maintain anfor an illustration of a patient with aopen (patent) airway. See Figure 22.2
tracheostomy tube in place.
Placement of a tracheostomy tube may be performed emergently or as a
planned procedure due to the following:
â¢  A large object blocking the airway
â¢  Respiratory failure or arrest
â¢  Severe neck or mouth injuries
â¢  A swollen or blocked airway due to inhalation of harmful material such
as smoke, steam, or other toxic gases
â¢  Cancer of the throat or neck, which can affect breathing by pressing
on the airway
â¢  Paralysis of the muscles that affect swallowing
â¢  Surgery around the larynx that prevents normal breathing and
swallowing
â¢  Long-term oxygen therapy via a mechanical ventilator
See Figure 22.3
for an image of the parts of a tracheostomy tube. The
outside end of the outer cannula has a flange that is placed against the
patientâs neck. The flange is secured around the patientâs neck with tie
straps, and a split 4â³ x 4â³ tracheostomy dressing is placed under the flange
to absorb secretions. A cuff is typically present on the distal end of the
outer cannula to make a tight seal in the airway. (See the top image in
Figure 22.3.) The cuff is inflated and deflated with a syringe attached to the
pilot balloon. Most tracheostomy tubes have a hollow inner cannula inside
the outer cannula that is either disposable or removed for cleaning as part
of the tracheostomy care procedure. (See the middle image of Figure 22.3.)
A solid obturator is used during the initial tracheostomy insertion
procedure to help guide the outer cannula through the tracheostomy and
insertion and the inner cannula is slid into place.
When a tracheostomy is placed, the provider determines if a fenestrated
or unfenestrated outer cannula is needed based on the patientâs
condition. A fenestrated tube is used for patients who can speak with
their tracheostomy tube in place. Under the guidance of a speech
pathologist and respiratory therapist, the inner cannula is eventually
removed from a fenestrated tube and the cuff deflated so the patient isable to speak. Otherwise, a patient with a tracheostomy tube is unable to
speak because there is no airflow over the vocal cords, and alternative
communication measures, such as a whiteboard, pen and paper, or
computer device with note-taking ability, must be put into place by the
nurse. Suctioning should never be performed through a fenestrated tube
without first inserting a nonfenestrated inner cannula, or severe tracheal
for images of a fenestrated anddamage can occur. See Figure 22.4

CHAPTER 22 TRACHEOSTOMY CARE & SUCTIONING 22.3 Assessments Related to Airway Suctioning,"Objective Assessment Prior to suctioning, a baseline assessment for indications of respiratory
distress and the need for suctioning should be obtained and documented,
including, but not limited to, the following:
â¢  Secretions from the mouth and/or tracheal stoma
â¢  Auscultation of lung sounds
â¢  Heart rate
â¢  Respiratory rate
â¢  Cardiac rhythm
â¢  Oxygen saturation
â¢  Skin color and perfusion
â¢  Effectiveness of cough
Prepare the patient by explaining the procedure and providing adequatesedation and pain relief as needed. Place the patient in semi-Fowlerâs
position if conscious or in a lateral position facing you if they are
unconscious. While suctioning the patient, if signs of worsening
respiratory distress occur, stop the procedure and request emergency
assistance. The following should be monitored during and following the
procedure:
â¢  Lung sounds
â¢  Skin color
â¢  Breathing pattern and rate
â¢  Oxygenation (pulse oximeter)
â¢  Pulse rate
â¢  Dysrhythmias if electrocardiogram is available
â¢  Color, consistency, and volume of secretions
â¢  Presence of bleeding or evidence of physical trauma
â¢  Subjective response including pain
â¢  Cough
â¢  Laryngospasm (spasm of the vocal cords that can result in airway
obstruction)
After completing suctioning, the outcomes from the procedure should be
evaluated and documented, including the following:
â¢  Improvement of lung sounds
â¢  Removal of secretions
â¢  Improvement of pulse oximetry
â¢  Decreased work of breathing
â¢  Stabilized respiratory rate
â¢  Decreased dyspnea
Be aware that the patientâs lung sounds may not clear completely aftersuctioning, but the removal of secretions should improve the patency of
the patientâs airway.
Potential complications resulting from this procedure include nasal
irritation/bleeding, gagging/vomiting, discomfort and pain, and
uncontrolled coughing. Potential adverse reactions include mucosal
hemorrhage, laceration of nasal turbinate, perforation of the pharynx,
hypoxia/hypoxemia, cardiac dysrhythmias/arrest, bradycardia, elevated
blood pressure, hypotension, respiratory arrest, laryngospasm,
bronchoconstriction, bronchospasm, hospital-acquired infection,

CHAPTER 22 TRACHEOSTOMY CARE & SUCTIONING Documentation,"Replacing and Cleaning an Inner Cannula The primary purpose of the inner cannula is to prevent tracheostomy tube
obstruction. Many sources of obstruction can be prevented if the inner
cannula is regularly cleaned and replaced. Some inner cannulas are
designed to be disposable, while others are reusable for a number of days.
Follow agency policy for inner cannula replacement or cleaning, but as a
rule of thumb, inner cannula cleaning should be performed every 12-24
hours at a minimum. Cleaning may be needed more frequently
depending on the type of equipment, the amount and thickness of
secretions, and the patientâs ability to cough up the secretions.
Changing the inner cannula may encourage the patient to cough and
bring mucus out of the tracheostomy. For this reason, the inner cannula
should be replaced prior to changing the tracheostomy dressing to
prevent secretions from soiling the new dressing. If the inner cannula isdisposable, no cleaning is required.","CHAPTER 22 TRACHEOSTOMY CARE & SUCTIONING Documentation Replacing and Cleaning an Inner Cannula The primary purpose of the inner cannula is to prevent tracheostomy tube

6.  Perform tracheal suctioning if indicated.
7.  Remove and discard the trach dressing. Inspect drainage on the
dressing for color and amount and note any odor.
8.  Inspect stoma site for redness, drainage, and signs and symptoms of
infection.
9.  Remove the gloves and perform proper hand hygiene.
10.  Open the sterile package and loosen the bottle cap of sterile saline.
11.  Don one sterile glove on the dominant hand.
12.  Open the sterile drape and place it on the patientâs chest.
13.  Set up the equipment on the sterile field.
14.  Remove the cap and pour saline in both basins with ungloved hand
(4â³-6â above basin).
15.  Don the second sterile glove.
16.  Prepare and arrange supplies.  Place pipe cleaners, trach ties, trach
dressing, and forceps on the field. Moisten cotton applicators and
place them in the third (empty) basin. Moisten two 4â³ x 4â³ pads in
saline, wring out, open, and separately place each one in the third
basin. Leave one 4â³ x 4â³ dry.
17.  With nondominant âcontaminatedâ hand, remove the trach collar (if
applicable) and remove (unlock and twist) the inner cannula. If the
patient requires continuous supplemental oxygen, place the
oxygenation device near the outer cannula or ask a staff member to
assist in maintaining the oxygen supply to the patient.
18.  Place the inner cannula in the saline basin.
19.  Pick up the inner cannula with your nondominant hand, holding it
20.  With your dominant hand, use a brush to clean the inner cannula.
Place the brush back into the saline basin.
21.  After cleaning, place the inner cannula in the second saline basin with
your nondominant hand and agitate for approximately 10 seconds to
rinse off debris. Repeat cleansing with brush as needed.
22.  Dry the inner cannula with the pipe cleaners and place the inner
cannula back into the outer cannula. Lock it into place and pull gently
to ensure it is locked appropriately. Reattach the preexisting
oxygenation device.
23.  Clean the stoma with cotton applicators using one on the superior
aspect and one on the inferior aspect.
24.  With your dominant, noncontaminated hand, moisten sterile gauze
with sterile saline and wring out excess. Assess the stoma for infection
and skin breakdown caused by flange pressure. Clean the stoma with
the moistened gauze starting at the 12 oâclock position of the stoma
and wipe toward the 3 oâclock position. Begin again with a new gauze
square at 12 oâclock and clean toward 9 oâclock. To clean the lower half
of the site, start at the 3 oâclock position and clean toward 6 oâclock;
then wipe from 9 oâclock to 6 oâclock, using a clean moistened gauze
square for each wipe. Continue this pattern on the surrounding skin
and tube flange. Avoid using a hydrogen peroxide mixture because it
can impair healing.
25.  Use sterile gauze to dry the area.
26.  Apply the sterile tracheostomy split sponge dressing by only touching
the outer edges.
27.  Replace trach ties as needed. (The literature overwhelmingly
recommends a two-person technique when changing the securing
device to prevent tube dislodgement. In the two-person technique,
one person holds the trach tube in place while the other changes the
securing device). Thread the clean tie through the opening on one
side of the trach tube. Bring the tie around the back of the neck,
keeping one end longer than the other. Secure the tie on the opposite
the tie.
28.  Remove the old tracheostomy ties.
29.  Remove gloves and perform proper hand hygiene.
30.  Provide oral care. Oral care keeps the mouth and teeth not only clean,
but also has been shown to prevent hospital-acquired pneumonia.
31.  Lower the bed to lowest the position. If the patient is on a mechanical
ventilator, the head of the bed should be maintained at 30-45 degrees
to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.
32.  Assist the patient to a comfortable position, ask if they have any
questions, and thank them for their time.
33.  Ensure safety measures when leaving the room:

CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT 23.2 IV Therapy Basics,"Primary IV Fluid Infusion Primary IV fluid infusions are prescribed by health care providers to restore
or maintain hydration and electrolyte status within the body. When
administering IV fluids to a patient, the nurse must continually monitor
the patientâs fluid and electrolyte status to evaluate the effectiveness of
the infusion and to avoid potential complications of fluid overload and
electrolyte imbalance.
The most commonly used primary IV fluid bag contains 1,000 mL. There
are also 500 mL, 250 mL, 100 mL, and 50 mL bags. The size of the primary
fluid bag is based on infusion need, patient condition, and age. Most adult
patients receive continuous IV fluids with 1,000 mL bags due to the higher
drip (gtt) rate. Many other fluid volume bags are used for intermittent
infusions or short-term therapy.
For example, for renal dialysis patients, IV bags smaller than 1,000 mL are
used because large amounts of continuous fluids are contraindicated due
to their renal impairment. Many institutions will hang smaller volume
normal saline continuous infusion bags just to serve as an additional
reminder that these patients should not receive large amounts of primary
fluids. Another example of patients requiring smaller IV bags are pediatricpatients who, due to their smaller anatomical size, do not require large
primary fluid infusion volumes.
Primary fluids are typically administered using an IV pump. An IV pump is
the safest method of administration to ensure specific amounts of fluid
are administered. However, there may be situations when IV pumps are
not available and nurses administer primary fluids by gravity using driptubing. Read more about calculating infusion rates in the âMathCalculationâ chapter.
Primary fluids are run at consistent infusion rates for a prescribed period of
time. For example, a continuous fluid infusion may be ordered at a rate of
125 mL/hour for 24 hours. Continuous fluids may also be ordered to run
until the provider gives a follow-up order to discontinue or decrease the
fluid rate.
IV primary fluid bags consist of various types of fluid such as 0.9% normal
saline, 0.45% (Â½) normal saline, lactated ringers solution, and dextrose (5%)
preparations. They may also contain replacement electrolytes like
potassium chloride. The provider will order primary fluids based on the
patientâs fluid and electrolyte statuses.
There are three types of intravenous fluid concentrations: isotonic,
hypertonic, and hypotonic fluids.
â¢  Isotonic fluids are typically administered for fluid and electrolyte
replacement. Isotonic fluids have a similar concentration to the solutes
contained in blood, so they do not cause the osmotic movement of
fluid into or out of the patientâs individual cells. An example of isotonic
fluid is 0.9% normal saline.
â¢  Hypertonic fluids have a higher concentration of solutes than blood.
They are typically used in critical care situations to treat hyponatremia
and avoid pulmonary edema by relying on osmosis to help remove
excess fluid. An example of a hypertonic fluid is dextrose 5% in 0.9%
â¢  Hypotonic fluids have a lower concentration of solutes than blood. The
goal of hypotonic fluid administration is to move fluids into a patientâs
cells due to osmosis. Hypotonic solutions are commonly used when a
patient has severe intracellular dehydration such as during diabetic
ketoacidosis. An example of hypotonic fluid is 0.45% normal saline (1/
2NS). See Figure 23.1
1 for an example of the effects of the
administration of hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic IV fluids on a
patientâs red blood cells.
Because a patientâs fluid and electrolyte statuses are constantly changing
when receiving IV fluids, it is important for the nurse to monitor for signs
of fluid or electrolyte imbalances and appropriately notify the health care
provider of any concerns. For example, primary fluids may be started at a
higher rate of infusion when a patient is receiving nothing by mouth
It is important for the nurse to continually monitor a patientâs skin turgor,
urinary output, lung sounds, and oxygen requirements and to assess for
any new edema to offer important insight into their fluid volume status. A
nurse must also evaluate the effects of replacement fluids and discuss
their ongoing need with the prescribing provider.","CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT 23.2 IV Therapy Basics Primary IV Fluid Infusion Primary IV fluid infusions are prescribed by health care providers to restore

CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT 23.2 IV Therapy Basics,"Secondary Fluid Infusion Secondary IV fluid administration is usually an intermittent infusion that
infuses at regular intervals (e.g., every 8 hours). This form of IV therapy
usually contains medications that are supplied in a smaller infusion bag
and mixed with a diluent fluid like saline (e.g., IV antibiotics). Many
common preparations come in 25 to 100 mL bags.
Secondary IV therapy is often referred to as âIV piggybackâ (IVPB)
medication because it is attached to the primary bag of intravenous fluids.
In this case, the primary line maintains venous access between drug
doses.
It is important to remember that not all IV solutions are compatible with
all IV medications. It is vital for the nurse to triple check that the secondary
medications/fluids are compatible with primary fluids. If medication and
fluids are not compatible, a precipitate may form when the fluids mix
within the line, posing a significant health danger for the patient.","CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT 23.2 IV Therapy Basics Secondary Fluid Infusion Secondary IV fluid administration is usually an intermittent infusion that

CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT 23.2 IV Therapy Basics,"IV Administration Equipment Intravenous (IV) fluids and medications are administered through flexible
plastic tubing called an IV administration set. The IV administration set
major types of IV administration sets: primary tubing and secondary
tubing. Additionally, IV fluids can be administered by gravity or by infusion
pump, and each method requires its own administration set.
Primary and Secondary Administration Sets
PRIMARY IV ADMINISTRATION SETSPrimary IV administration sets are used to infuse continuous or
intermittent fluids or medications. Primary IV tubing can be a macro-drip
or micro-drip solution set.  A macro-drip infusion set delivers 10, 15, or 20
drops per milliliter, whereas a micro-drip infusion set delivers 60 drops per
milliliter. The drop factor is located on the packaging of the IV tubing and
is important to verify when calculating medication administration rates.
Macro-drip sets are used for routine primary infusions for adults. Micro-
drip IV tubing is used in pediatric or neonatal care where small amounts
of fluids are administered over a long period of time.
Primary IV administration sets consist of the following parts:
Sterile spike: This part of the tubing must be kept sterile as you spike the
IV fluid bag.
Drip chamber: The drip chamber allows air to rise out from a fluid so that
it is not passed onto the patient. It is also used to calculate the rate at
which fluid is administered by gravity (drops per minute). It should be kept
Â¼ to Â½ full of solution.
Backcheck valve: A backcheck valve prevents fluid or medication from
travelling up into the primary IV bag.
Access ports: Access ports are used to infuse secondary medications and
to administer IV push medications. These may also be referred to as âY
ports.â
Roller clamp: A roller clamp is used to regulate the speed, or stop, an
infusion by gravity.
SECONDARY IV ADMINISTRATION SETSSecondary IV administration sets are used to intermittently administer a
secondary medication, such as an antibiotic, while the primary IV is also
running. Secondary IV tubing is shorter in length than primary tubing and
is connected to a primary line via an access port or an IV pump. The
secondary infusion is hung above the primary infusion and connected at
an access port.
Secondary fluids should always be âpiggybackedâ into primary infusion
lines to ensure that the correct amount of medication is infused. By
piggybacking a medication, the solution from the primary fluid line is
used to prime the secondary tubing. However, if a secondary infusion is
run as a primary fluid, there is a risk of losing some of the secondary
medication when priming the line, which results in less medication being
administered. Loss of medication is considered a medication error
because the patient received less active medication than prescribed.

IV Administration
When initiating or changing an IV bag of fluids or medications, it is
important to remember these items:
â¢  IV fluids are a medication. Verify physician orders and check that the
patient does not have an allergy to this medication. Perform the six
rights of medication administration three times as you would when
giving any other medication. Check the type of fluid and the
expiration date, and verify the fluid is free of discoloration and
sediment. Check the expiration date when obtaining a new tubing
administration set.
â¢  Examine the bag to ensure that the bag itself is intact and not leaking.
There may be moisture on the inside of the plastic IV bag storage
container; this is normal.
â¢  Verify the infusion rate of IV fluids is appropriate based on the patientâs
age, size, preexisting medical conditions, and prescribed indication. If
a manual calculation is needed to set the IV  flow rate, calculate the
rate and double-check the calculated rate with another registered
nurse.
â¢  IV tubing administration sets require routine replacement to prevent
infection. Follow agency policy regarding initiating tubing change
before initiating a new bag of fluid or medications.
â¢  If administration set tubing is present, trace the tubing from the
patient to its point of origin to make sure that youâre accessing the
correct port.
â¢  Assess the IV site. Inspect for redness, swelling, or tenderness that can
be a sign of irritation, inflammation, or infection.
â¢  Ensure the IV site is patent when initiating new fluid or medication.
Aspirate for blood return and flush the IV catheter according to
agency policy.","CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT 23.2 IV Therapy Basics IV Administration Equipment Intravenous (IV) fluids and medications are administered through flexible

milliliter. The drop factor is located on the packaging of the IV tubing and
is important to verify when calculating medication administration rates.
Macro-drip sets are used for routine primary infusions for adults. Micro-
drip IV tubing is used in pediatric or neonatal care where small amounts
of fluids are administered over a long period of time.
Primary IV administration sets consist of the following parts:
Sterile spike: This part of the tubing must be kept sterile as you spike the
IV fluid bag.
Drip chamber: The drip chamber allows air to rise out from a fluid so that
it is not passed onto the patient. It is also used to calculate the rate at
which fluid is administered by gravity (drops per minute). It should be kept
Â¼ to Â½ full of solution.
Backcheck valve: A backcheck valve prevents fluid or medication from
travelling up into the primary IV bag.
Access ports: Access ports are used to infuse secondary medications and
to administer IV push medications. These may also be referred to as âY
ports.â
Roller clamp: A roller clamp is used to regulate the speed, or stop, an
infusion by gravity.
SECONDARY IV ADMINISTRATION SETSSecondary IV administration sets are used to intermittently administer a
secondary medication, such as an antibiotic, while the primary IV is also
running. Secondary IV tubing is shorter in length than primary tubing and
is connected to a primary line via an access port or an IV pump. The
secondary infusion is hung above the primary infusion and connected at
an access port.
Secondary fluids should always be âpiggybackedâ into primary infusion
lines to ensure that the correct amount of medication is infused. By
piggybacking a medication, the solution from the primary fluid line is
used to prime the secondary tubing. However, if a secondary infusion is
run as a primary fluid, there is a risk of losing some of the secondary
medication when priming the line, which results in less medication being
administered. Loss of medication is considered a medication error
because the patient received less active medication than prescribed.

IV Administration
When initiating or changing an IV bag of fluids or medications, it is
important to remember these items:
â¢  IV fluids are a medication. Verify physician orders and check that the
patient does not have an allergy to this medication. Perform the six
rights of medication administration three times as you would when
giving any other medication. Check the type of fluid and the
expiration date, and verify the fluid is free of discoloration and
sediment. Check the expiration date when obtaining a new tubing
administration set.
â¢  Examine the bag to ensure that the bag itself is intact and not leaking.
There may be moisture on the inside of the plastic IV bag storage
container; this is normal.
â¢  Verify the infusion rate of IV fluids is appropriate based on the patientâs
age, size, preexisting medical conditions, and prescribed indication. If
a manual calculation is needed to set the IV  flow rate, calculate the
rate and double-check the calculated rate with another registered
nurse.
â¢  IV tubing administration sets require routine replacement to prevent
infection. Follow agency policy regarding initiating tubing change
before initiating a new bag of fluid or medications.
â¢  If administration set tubing is present, trace the tubing from the
patient to its point of origin to make sure that youâre accessing the
correct port.
â¢  Assess the IV site. Inspect for redness, swelling, or tenderness that can
be a sign of irritation, inflammation, or infection.
â¢  Ensure the IV site is patent when initiating new fluid or medication.
Aspirate for blood return and flush the IV catheter according to
agency policy.",1093
CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT 23.2 IV Therapy Basics,"Complications of IV Therapy While monitoring a patient receiving IV fluids, it is important to assess for
potential complications such as infiltration, extravasation, phlebitis, or
infection. If these conditions occur, promptly notify the provider for
treatment; the IV catheter will need to be removed and replaced at an
alternative site, and additional medication may be prescribed.
Infiltration occurs when the tip of the catheter slips out of the vein. The
catheter passes through the wall of the vein, or the blood vessel wall
allows part of the fluid to infuse into the surrounding tissue, resulting in
the leakage of IV fluids into the surrounding tissue. Infiltration may cause
pain, swelling, and skin that is cool to the touch. If you are concerned an IV
is infiltrated, follow your facility policy and, as a general guideline,
discontinue the site and relocate the IV. If the infiltration is severe, you
may consider the application of a compress in addition to elevating the
affected limb. Check your institutionâs policy regarding which type of
compress (warm or cold) should be applied.
Additionally, clinical
pharmacists can also be helpful resources for determining the appropriate
type of infiltration treatment.
Extravasation refers to infiltration of damaging intravenous medications,
such as chemotherapy, into the extravascular tissue around the site of
infusion. Extravasation causes tissue injury, and depending on the
medication, site, and length of exposure, it can cause tissue death, which
is also referred to as necrosis. If detected early, extravasation may be
treated with medications that help avoid the complication of necrosis.
Phlebitis is inflammation of a vein. Phlebitis of superficial veins can occur
due to trauma to the vein during insertion of the IV catheter. It can cause
redness and tenderness along the vein and can lead to infection if not
treated appropriately. Treatment may include warm compresses and
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.
an IV catheter. Signs of infection include redness, warmth, tenderness, and
possible fever. Vascular catheterâassociated infection is considered a
hospital-acquired condition because it can be prevented using best
practices. Be sure to follow evidence-based infection prevention practices,
such as performing hand hygiene, performing a vigorous mechanical
scrub of needleless connectors, limiting catheter access, and following
sterile no-touch technique during intravenous infusion to reduce the risk
of vascular catheterâassociated infection.","CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT 23.2 IV Therapy Basics Complications of IV Therapy While monitoring a patient receiving IV fluids, it is important to assess for

CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT 23.3 Intravenous Therapy Assessment,"Subjective Assessment When performing the subjective assessment, the nurse should begin by
focusing on data collection that may signify a potential complication if a
patient receives IV infusion therapy. The nurse should begin by identifying
if the patient has medication allergies or a latex allergy. The patientâs
history should also be considered with special attention given to those
with known congestive heart failure (CHF) or chronic kidney disease (CKD)
because they are more susceptible to developing fluid overload.
Additionally, the patient should be asked if they have any pain or
discomfort in their IV access site now or during the infusion of
medications or fluids.

IV may be wrapped in gauze or an arm board may be used to deter the
child from tampering with the IV site or tubing. Additionally, the tubing
should be well-secured, and the dressing should remain free from
moisture so the IV site is not compromised. Be aware that mobile children
will require guidance to ensure that the tubing is not obstructed if they sit
or lie on the tubing accidentally.
Older Adults
Older adults with an IV infusion should be frequently monitored for the
development of fluid volume overload. Signs of fluid volume overload
include elevated blood pressure and respiratory rate, decreased oxygen
saturation, peripheral edema, fine crackles in the posterior lower lobes of
the lungs, or signs of worsening heart failure. Additionally, older adults
have delicate venous walls that may not withstand rapid infusion rates. It
is important to monitor the IV site patency carefully when infusing large
amounts of fluids at faster rates and appropriately modify the infusion
rate.","CHAPTER 23 IV THERAPY MANAGEMENT 23.3 Intravenous Therapy Assessment Subjective Assessment When performing the subjective assessment, the nurse should begin by
