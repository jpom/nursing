       "      <th>Ethical and Legal Considerations End-of-life care often includes unique complexities for the patient, family, and nurse. There may be times when what the physician or nurse believes to be the best treatment conflicts with what the patient desires. There may also be challenges related to decision-making that cause disagreements within a family or cause conflict with the treatment plan. Additional challenging factors include availability of resources and insurance company policies and programs. Despite these complexities, it is important for the nurse to honor and respect the wishes of the patient. Despite any conflicts in decision-making among health care providers, family members, and the patient, the nurse must always advocate for the patientâs wishes. Nurses should also be aware of the practice guidelines for ethical dilemmas stated in the American Nurses Associationâs Standards of Professional Nursing Practice and Code of Ethics.American Nurses Association. (2015). Code of ethics for nurses with interpretive statements. American Nurses Association. https://www.nursingworld.org/practice-policy/nursing-excellence/ethics/code-of-ethics-for-nurses/coe-view-only/,National Institute on Aging. (2017, May 17). What are palliative care and hospice care? U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services. https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-are-palliative-care-and-hospice-careÂ These resources assist the nurse in implementing expected behaviors according to their professional role as a nurse. If complex ethical dilemmas occur, many organizations have dedicated ethics committees that offer support, guidance, and resources for complex ethical decisions. These committees can serve as support systems, share resources, provide legal insight, and make recommendations for action. The nurse should feel supported in raising concerns within their health care organization if they believe an ethical dilemma is occurring. Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders and Advance Directives Additional legal considerations when providing care at the end of life are do-not-resuscitate orders (DNR) orders and advance directives. A do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order is a medical order that instructs health care professionals not to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if a patientâs breathing stops or their heart stops beating. The order is only written with the permission of the patient (or the patientâs health care power of attorney, if activated.) Ideally, a DNR order is set up before a critical condition occurs. CPR is emergency treatment provided when a patientâs blood flow or breathing stops that may involve chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth breathing, electric shocks to restart the heart, breathing tubes to open the airway, or cardiac medications. The DNR order only refers to not performing CPR and is recorded in a patientâs medical record. Wallet cards, bracelets, or other DNR documents are also available to have at home or in non-hospital settings. The decision to implement a DNR order is typically very difficult for a patient and their family members to make.A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia [Internet]. Atlanta (GA): A.D.A.M., Inc.; c1997-2021. Do-not-resuscitate order; [updated 2021, June 9].https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000473.htm Many people have unrealistic ideas regarding the success rates of CPR and the quality of life a patient experiences after being revived, especially for patients with multiple chronic diseases or those receiving palliative care. For example, a recent study found the overall rate of survival leading to hospital discharge for someone who experiences cardiac arrest is about 10.6 percent.Ouellette, L., Puro, A., Weatherhead, J., Shaheen, M., Chassee, T., Whalen, D., &amp; Jones, J.. (2018). Public knowledge and perceptions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR): Results of a multicenter survey. American Journal of Emergency Medicine, 36(10), 1900-1901. https://doi: 10.1016/j.ajem.2018.01.103. Nurses can provide up-to-date patient education regarding CPR and its effectiveness based on the patientâs current condition and facilitate discussion about a DNR order. Advance directives include the health care power of attorney and living will. The health care power of attorney legally identifies a trusted individual to serve as a decision maker for health issues when the patient is no longer able to speak for themselves. It is the responsibility of this designated individual to carry out care actions in accordance with the patientâs wishes. A health care power of attorney can be a trusted family member, friend, or colleague who is of sound mind and is over the age of 18. They should be someone who the patient is comfortable expressing their wishes to and someone who will enact those desired wishes on the patientâs behalf. The health care power of attorney should also have knowledge of the patientâs wishes outlined in their living will. A living will is a legal document that describes the patientâs wishes if they are no longer able to speak for themselves due to injury, illness, or a persistent vegetative state. The living will addresses issues like ventilator support, feeding tube placement, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and intubation. It is a vital means of ensuring that the health care provider has a record of oneâs wishes. However, the living will cannot feasibly cover every possible potential circumstance, so the health care power of attorney is vital when making decisions outside the scope of the living will document. Read more about advance care planning at the National Institute on Aging and at Honoring Choices Wisconsin. Nurses must understand the health care practice legalities for the state in which they practice nursing. There can be practice issues in various states that raise additional ethical complexities for the practicing nurse. For example, Oregon, Washington, Vermont, and New Mexico all have laws that allow patients to participate in assisted dying practices involving assisted suicide or active euthanasia. In assisted suicide, the patient is provided the means to carry out suicide such as a lethal dose of medication. Active euthanasia involves someone other than the patient carrying out action to end a personâs life. Most nursing organizations prevent a nurse from participating in assisted dying practices. Nurses must be aware of the Practice Act in their state and the legalities and ethical challenges of nursing actions surrounding complex issues such as assisted suicide, active euthanasia, and abortion.</th>\n",

       "      <th>Safe Patient Handling Assisting patients with decreased immobility poses an increased risk of injury to health care workers. A focus on safe patient handling and mobility (SPHM) in acute and long-term care over the past decade has resulted in decreased staff lifting injuries for the first time in 30 years. Nonetheless, nurses still suffer more musculoskeletal disorders from lifting than other employees in the manufacturing and construction industries. Many employers and nurses previously believed that lifting injuries could be prevented by using proper body mechanics, but evidence contradicts this assumption. Body mechanics involves the coordinated effort of muscles, bones, and oneâs nervous system to maintain balance, posture, and alignment when moving, transferring, and positioning patients.This work is a derivative of Clinical Procedures for Safer Patient Care by British Columbia Institute of Technology and is licensed under CC BY 4.0 The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) calculates maximum loads for lifting, pushing, pulling, and carrying for all types of employees. For example, a maximum load for employees lifting a box with handles is 50 pounds (23 kg), but this weight is decreased when the lifter has to reach, lift from near the floor, or assume a twisted or awkward position. Because patients donât come in simple shapes and may sit or lie in awkward positions, move unexpectedly, or have wounds or devices that interfere with lifting, the safe lifting load for patients is less than this maximum 50 pound load. Although using proper body mechanics and good lifting techniques are important, they donât prevent lifting injuries in these patient circumstancesThis work is a derivative of Clinical Procedures for Safer Patient Care by British Columbia Institute of Technology and is licensed under CC BY 4.0,American Nurses Association. (2014). Current topics in safe patient handling and mobility. American Nurse Today (supplement). https://www.myamericannurse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ant9-Patient-Handling-Supplement-821a_LOW.pdf,National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. (2013, August 2). Safe patient handling and mobility (SPHM). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/safepatient/default.html Factors that increase risk for lifting injuries in nurses are exertion, frequency, posture, and duration of exposure. Combinations of these factors, such as high exertion while in an awkward posture (for example, holding a patientâs leg while bent over and twisted), unpredictable patient movements, and extended reaching, intensify the risk.Francis, R., &amp; Dawson, M. (2016) Safe patient handling and mobility: The journey continues. American Nurse Today, 11(5). https://www.myamericannurse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Patient-Handling-Safety-426b.pdf In 2013 the American Nurses Association (ANA) published Safe Patient Handling and Mobility (SPHM) standards. See the standards in the following box. Learn more about safe patient handling using the following hyperlinks. View ANA videos on safe patient handling: Preventing Nurse Injuries and ANA Presents Safe Patient Handling and Mobility. Read an ANA article on Safe Patient Handling â The Journey Continues. ANA Standards for Safe Patient Handling and MobilityAmerican Nurses Association. (2014). Current topics in safe patient handling and mobility. American Nurse Today (supplement). https://www.myamericannurse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ant9-Patient-Handling-Supplement-821a_LOW.pdf Standard 1: Establish a culture of safety. This standard calls for the employer to establish a commitment to a culture of safety. This means prioritizing safety over competing goals in a blame-free environment where individuals can report errors or incidents without fear. The employer is compelled to evaluate systemic issues that contribute to incidents or accidents. The standard also calls for safe staffing levels and improved communication and collaboration. Every organization should have a procedure for nurses to report safety concerns or refuse an assignment due to concern about patientsâ or their own safety. Standard 2: Implement and sustain an SPHM program. This standard outlines SPHM program components, including patient assessment and written guidelines for safe patient handling by staff. Standard 3: Incorporate ergonomic design principles to provide a safe care environment. This standard is based on the concept of prevention of injuries through ergonomic design that considers the physical layout, work-process flow, and use of technology to reduce exposure to injury or illness. Standard 4: Select, install, and maintain SPHM technology. This standard provides guidance in selecting, installing, and maintaining SPHM technology. Standard 5: Establish a system for education, training, and maintaining competence. This standard outlines SPHM training for employees, including the demonstration of competency before using SPHM technology with patients. Standard 6: Integrate patient-centered SPHM assessment, plan of care, and use of SPHM technology. This standard focuses on the patientâs needs by establishing assessment guidelines and developing an individual plan of care. It outlines the importance of using SPHM technology in a therapeutic manner with the goal of promoting patientsâ independence. For example, a patient may need full-body lift technology immediately after surgery, then progress to a sit-to-stand lift for transfers, and then progress to a technology that supports ambulation. Standard 7: Include SPHM in reasonable accommodation and post-injury return to work. This standard promotes an employeeâs return to work after an injury. Standard 8: Establish a comprehensive evaluation system. The final standard calls for evaluation of outcomes related to an agencyâs implementation of a SPHM program with remediation of deficiencies.</th>\n",

       "      <th>Transfer From Bed to Chair or Wheelchair Patients often require assistance when moving from a bed to a chair or wheelchair. A patient must be cooperative and predictable, able to bear weight on both legs, and able to take small steps and pivot to safely transfer with a one-person assist. If any of these criteria are not met, a two-person transfer or mechanical lift is recommended. Always complete a mobility assessment and check the providerâs or physical therapistâs orders prior to transferring patients.This work is a derivative of Clinical Procedures for Safer Patient Care by British Columbia Institute of Technology and is licensed under CC BY 4.0 Begin by explaining to the patient what will happen during the transfer and how they can help. Be sure proper footwear is in place. Lower the bed; set it at a 45-degree angle. Place the wheelchair next to the bed and apply the wheelchair brakes. If the patient has weakness on one side, place the wheelchair on their strong side.This work is a derivative of Clinical Procedures for Safer Patient Care by British Columbia Institute of Technology and is licensed under CC BY 4.0 Assist the patient to a seated position on the side of the bed with their feet on the floor. (See the previous section on how to assist a patient to a seated position.) Apply the gait belt snugly around their waist. Place your legs on the outside of their legs. Ask them to place their hands on your waist as they raise themselves into a standing position. Do not lift the patient. If additional assistance is required, obtain a mechanical lift, such as a sit to stand device. Do not allow them to put their arms around your neck because this can cause back injury. Stay close to theÂ  patient during the transfer to keep the patientâs weight close to your center of gravity. Once standing, ask the patient to pivot and then take a few steps back until they can feel the wheelchair on the back of their legs. Have the patient grasp the arm of the wheelchair and lean forward slightly. Assist the patient to lower themselves, while shifting your weight from your back leg to the front leg with your knees bent, trunk straight, and elbows slightly bent. Allow the patient to slowly lower themselves into the wheelchair using the armrests for support.

       "   'ANA Scope and Standards of Practice The American Nurses Association (ANA) publishes two resources that set standards and guide professional nursing practice in the United States: The Code of Ethics for Nurses and Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice. The Code of Ethics for Nurses establishes an ethical framework for nursing practice across all roles, levels, and settings. It is discussed in greater detail in the â\\x80\\x9cLegal Considerations and Ethicsâ\\x80\\x9d subsection of this chapter. The Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice describes a professional nurseâ\\x80\\x99s scope of practice and defines the who, what, where, when, why, and how of nursing. It also sets 18 standards of professional practice that all registered nurses are expected to perform competently. American Nurses Association. (2021). Nursing: Scope and standards of practice (4th ed.). American Nurses Association  The â\\x80\\x9cwhoâ\\x80\\x9d of nursing practice are the nurses who have been educated, titled, and maintain active licensure to practice nursing. The â\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x9d of nursing is the recently revised definition of nursing: â\\x80\\x9cNursing integrates the art and science of caring and focuses on the protection, promotion, and optimization of health and human functioning; prevention of illness and injury; facilitation of healing; and alleviation of suffering through compassionate presence. Nursing is the diagnosis and treatment of human responses and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, groups, communities, and populations in recognition of the connection of all humanity.â\\x80\\x9dAmerican Nurses Association. (2021). Nursing: Scope and standards of practice (4th ed.). American Nurses Association Simply put, nurses treat human responses to health problems and life processes and advocate for the care of others. Nursing practice occurs â\\x80\\x9cwhenâ\\x80\\x9d there is a need for nursing knowledge, wisdom, caring, leadership, practice, or education, anytime, anywhere. Nursing practice occurs in any environment â\\x80\\x9cwhereâ\\x80\\x9d there is a health care consumer in need of care, information, or advocacy. The â\\x80\\x9cwhyâ\\x80\\x9d of nursing practice is described as nursingâ\\x80\\x99s response to the changing needs of society to achieve positive health care consumer outcomes in keeping with nursingâ\\x80\\x99s social contract and obligation to society. The â\\x80\\x9chowâ\\x80\\x9d of nursing practice is defined as the ways, means, methods, and manners that nurses use to practice professionally.American Nurses Association. (2021). Nursing: Scope and standards of practice (4th ed.). American Nurses Association The â\\x80\\x9chowâ\\x80\\x9d of nursing is further defined by the standards of practice set by the ANA. There are two sets of standards, the Standards of Professional Nursing Practice and the Standards of Professional Performance. The Standards of Professional Nursing Practice are â\\x80\\x9cauthoritative statements of the actions and behaviors that all registered nurses, regardless of role, population, specialty, and setting, are expected to perform competently.â\\x80\\x9dAmerican Nurses Association. (2021). Nursing: Scope and standards of practice (4th ed.). American Nurses Association These standards define a competent level of nursing practice based on the critical thinking model known as the nursing process. The nursing process includes the components of assessment, diagnosis, outcomes identification, planning, implementation, and evaluation.American Nurses Association. (2021). Nursing: Scope and standards of practice (4th ed.). American Nurses Association. Each of these standards is further discussed in the â\\x80\\x9cNursing Processâ\\x80\\x9d chapter of this book. The Standards of Professional Performance are 12 additional standards that describe a nurseâ\\x80\\x99s professional behavior, including activities related to ethics, advocacy, respectful and equitable practice, communication, collaboration, leadership, education, scholarly inquiry, quality of practice, professional practice evaluation, resource stewardship, and environmental health. All registered nurses are expected to engage in these professional role activities based on their level of education, position, and role. Registered nurses are accountable for their professional behaviors to themselves, health care consumers, peers, and ultimately to society. American Nurses Association. (2021). Nursing: Scope and standards of practice (4th ed.). American Nurses Association. The 2021 Standards of Professional Performance are as follows: Ethics. The registered nurse integrates ethics in all aspects of practice. Advocacy.Â\\xa0The registered nurse demonstrates advocacy in all roles and settings. Respectful and Equitable Practice. The registered nurse practices with cultural humility and inclusiveness. Communication. The registered nurse communicates effectively in all areas of professional practice. Collaboration. The registered nurse collaborates with the health care consumer and other key stakeholders. Leadership. The registered nurse leads within the profession and practice setting. Education. The registered nurse seeks knowledge and competence that reflects current nursing practice and promotes futuristic thinking. Scholarly Inquiry. The registered nurse integrates scholarship, evidence, and research findings into practice. Quality of Practice. The registered nurse contributes to quality nursing practice. Professional Practice Evaluation. The registered nurse evaluates oneâ\\x80\\x99s own and othersâ\\x80\\x99 nursing practice. Resource Stewardship. The registered nurse utilizes appropriate resources to plan, provide, and sustain evidence-based nursing services that are safe, effective, financially responsible, and judiciously used. Environmental Health. The registered nurse practices in a manner that advances environmental safety and health.American Nurses Association. (2021). Nursing: Scope and standards of practice (4th ed.). American Nurses Association. Years ago, nurses were required to recite the Nightingale pledge to publicly confirm their commitment to maintain the professionâ\\x80\\x99s high ethical and moral values: â\\x80\\x9cI will do all in my power to maintain and elevate the standard of my profession and will hold in confidence all personal matters committed to my keeping and family affairs coming to my knowledge in the practice of my calling, with loyalty will I endeavor to aid the physician in his work, and devote myself to the welfare of those committed to my care.â\\x80\\x9d Although some of the words are outdated, the meaning is clear: Nursing is a calling, not just a job; to answer that call, you must be dedicated to serve your community according to the ANA standards of care and code of ethics.Bostain, L.

       "   'Nurse Practice Act In addition to the professional standards of practice and professional performance set by the American Nurses Association, nurses must legally follow regulations set by the Nurse Practice Act and enforced by the Board of Nursing in the state where they are employed. The Board of Nursing is the state-specific licensing and regulatory body that sets standards for safe nursing care and issues nursing licenses to qualified candidates, based on the Nurse Practice Act  enacted by that stateâ\\x80\\x99s legislature. The Nurse Practice Act establishes regulations for nursing practice within that state and defines the scope of nursing practice. If nurses do not follow the standards and scope of practice set forth by the Nurse Practice Act, they can have their nursing license revoked by the Board of Nursing. To read more about the the Wisconsin Board of Nursing, Standards of Practice, and Rules of Conduct, use the hyperlinked PDFs provided below.Wisconsin Administrative Code. (2018). Chapter N 6 standards of practice for registered nurses and licensed practical nurses. https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/n/6.pdf Read more details about the Wisconsin Administrative Code and the Board of Nursing. Read about Wisconsin Standards of Practice for Nurses in Chapter N 6. Read about Wisconsin Rules of Conduct in Chapter N 7. Nursing students must understand their scope of practice outlined in their stateâ\\x80\\x99s Nurse Practice Act. Nursing students are legally accountable for the quality of care they provide to patients just as nurses are accountable. Students are expected to recognize the limits of their knowledge and experience and appropriately alert individuals in authority regarding situations that are beyond their competency. A violation of the standards of practice constitutes unprofessional conduct and can result in the Board of Nursing denying a license to a nursing graduate.')),\n",

       "   'Employer Policies, Procedures, and Protocols In addition to professional nursing standards set by the American Nurses Association and the state Nurse Practice Act where they work, nurses and nursing students must also practice according to agency policies, procedures, and protocols. For example, hospitals often set a policy that requires a thorough skin assessment must be completed and documented daily on every patient. If a nurse did not follow this policy and a patient developed a pressure injury, the nurse could be held liable. In addition, every agency has their own set of procedures and protocols that a nurse and nursing student must follow.Â\\xa0 For example, each agency has specific procedural steps for performing nursing skills, such as inserting urinary catheters. A protocol  is defined by the Wisconsin Nurse Practice Act as a â\\x80\\x9cprecise and detailed written plan for a regimen of therapy.â\\x80\\x9d For example, agencies typically have a hypoglycemia protocol that nurses automatically implement when a patientâ\\x80\\x99s blood sugar falls below a specific number. The hypoglycemia protocol includes actions such as providing orange juice and rechecking the blood sugar. These agency-specific policies, procedures, and protocols supersede the information taught in nursing school, and nurses and nursing students can be held legally liable if they donâ\\x80\\x99t follow them. Therefore, it is vital for nurses and nursing students to always review and follow current agency-specific procedures, policies, and protocols when providing patient care. Nurses and nursing students must continue to follow their scope of practice as defined by the Nurse Practice Act in the state they are practicing when following agency policies, procedures, and protocols. Situations have occurred when a nurse or nursing student was asked by an agency to do something outside their defined scope of practice that impaired their nursing license. It is always up to you to protect your nursing license and follow the stateâ\\x80\\x99s Nurse Practice Act when providing patient care.')),\n",

      "('Scope of Practice 1.4 Health Care Settings & Team', 'Health Care Settings There are several levels of health care including primary, secondary, and tertiary care. Each of these levels focuses on different aspects of health care and is typically provided in different settings. Primary Care Primary care promotes wellness and prevents disease. This care includes health promotion, education, protection (such as immunizations), early disease screening, and environmental considerations. Settings providing this type of health care include physician offices, public health clinics, school nursing, and community health nursing. Secondary care Secondary care occurs when a person has contracted an illness or injury and requires medical care. Secondary care is often referred to as acute care. Secondary care can range from uncomplicated care to repair a small laceration or treat a strep throat infection to more complicated emergent care such as treating a head injury sustained in an automobile accident. Whatever the problem, the patient needs medical and nursing attention to return to a state of health and wellness. Secondary care is provided in settings such as physician offices, clinics, urgent care facilities, or hospitals. Specialized units include areas such as burn care, neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, and transplant services. Tertiary Care Tertiary care addresses the long-term effects from chronic illnesses or conditions with the purpose to restore a patientâ\\x80\\x99s maximum physical and mental function. The goal of tertiary care is to achieve the highest level of functioning possible while managing the chronic illness. For example, a patient who falls and fractures their hip will need secondary care to set the broken bones, but may need tertiary care to regain their strength and ability to walk even after the bones have healed. Patients with incurable diseases, such as dementia, may need specialized tertiary care to provide support they need for daily functioning. Tertiary care settings include rehabilitation units, assisted living facilities, adult day care, skilled nursing units, home care, and hospice centers.')\n",
